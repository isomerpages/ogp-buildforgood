title: Build for Good
description: Build for Good is a month-long hackathon for citizens to build
  solutions to tackle public good problems in Singapore. Throughout the month,
  participating teams will scope out problem statements, identify solutions,
  build prototypes, and test them with users. At the end of the month, they will
  present their solutions to government leaders, and selected teams will receive
  funding and go through an accelerator programme to launch their solutions.

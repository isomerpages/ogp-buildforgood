### What are some pressing problems in Singapore? Share them with us!

Whether you're an individual or representing a non-profit, tell us more about the problems that you believe Singapore is facing. By sharing these problem statements, our builders will have the opportunity to tackle some of these problems during Build for Good and work towards a better Singapore. These submissions will also help us better understand problems that citizens care most about.

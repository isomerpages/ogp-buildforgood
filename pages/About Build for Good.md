#### **Empowering citizens to contribute and lead the change to make Singapore better**

Build for Good is a month-long hackathon organised by [Open Government Products](https://open.gov.sg) for citizens to build solutions that tackle various problems in Singapore. Participating teams will choose a problem to work on, identify solutions, build prototypes, and test them with users. They will be provided the necessary support through their journey such as domain expertise, mentorship, workshops and resources. At the finale, teams will present their solutions to government leaders and industry experts. Winning teams will receive sponsorship and go through a 2-month accelerator to further develop their products, and potentially launch them with real users.

Through Build for Good, we want to build a place where people can feel empowered to make our world just a little bit better than it was before. A place where we may not always succeed, but where we will always try. A place where people can build for good.

#### **Empowering citizens to contribute and lead the change to make Singapore better**

Build for Good is a month-long hackathon organised by [Open Government Products](https://open.gov.sg) for citizens to build solutions that tackle various problems in Singapore. Participating teams will choose a problem to work on, identify solutions, build prototypes, and test them with users. They will be provided the necessary support through their journey such as mentorship, workshops and resources. At the finale, teams will present their solutions to government leaders and industry experts, and winning teams will receive sponsorship for further product development.

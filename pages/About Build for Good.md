#### **Empowering citizens to contribute and lead the change to make Singapore better**

Build for Good is a month-long hackathon organised by [Open Government Products](open.gov.sg) for citizens to build solutions that tackle various problems in Singapore. Participating teams will choose a problem to work on, identify solutions, build prototypes, and test them with users. They will be provided the necessary support through their journey such as mentorship, workshops and resources. At the finale, teams will present their solutions to government leaders and industry experts, and winning teams will receive sponsorship for further product development.

In the face of various problems in Singapore, many citizens are disengaged and disempowered, relying on top-down solutions to address them instead. However, ground-up solutions also play a huge role in deeply understanding and tailoring to the specific needs of a community. With many in Singapore having the skills and heart for public good, there remains a lot of untapped potential in getting citizens involved to identify important problems and build solutions for public good.

Through Build for Good, it aims to empower citizens to contribute and lead the change in making Singapore better.

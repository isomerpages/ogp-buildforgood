#### **Empowering citizens to contribute and lead the change to make Singapore better**

Build for Good is a citizen engagement initiative by [Open Government Products](https://open.gov.sg) that aims to empower citizens to make Singapore better in their own ways. Citizens can be part of the initiative by joining our Build for Good hackathon, accelerator (for hackathon winning teams) or community.

We want to build a space where people feel empowered and inspired to make our world just a little bit better than it was before. A place where we may not always succeed, but where we will always try. A place where people can build for good.

#### Build for Good hackathon and accelerator

Build for Good runs annual month-long citizen hackathons where teams will choose a public good problem to work on, identify solutions, build prototypes, and test them with users. They will be provided the necessary support through their journey such as domain expertise, mentorship, workshops and resources. At the finale, teams will present their solutions to government leaders and industry experts. Winning teams will receive funding and go through a 2-month accelerator to further develop their products, and potentially launch them with real users. 

To date, we have run two Build for Good hackathons - engaging a total of 160 builders who built 30 impactful solutions for public good. Check out the highlights of our past Build for Good hackathons [here](/bfg-environment/).

We just launched sign-ups for our third Build for Good hackathon - find out more and sign up [here](/builder)!

#### Build for Good community

The Build for Good community aims to bring together citizens who are passionate about making Singapore better. Through talks, workshops and networking sessions, we hope to spark conversations around important issues in Singapore and inspire more citizens to act on them. Join our Build for Good community group on [Telegram](go.gov.sg/bfgcommunity) to receive the latest updates on our events!

<h4>3 Things Your Problem Statement Should Have</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Background and context of the problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People affected by the problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The impact of the problem</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>3 Tips For Writing</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Do not include solutions in your problem statement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be concrete</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be specific</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Often, public good problems can be quite broad. However, you don't have
to solve the entire problem from start to end to make an impact. You can
start from a smaller, more scoped out problem and address it well with
an effective solution.</p>
<h4>Good Example</h4>
<p>60% of Singaporeans lack the knowledge of what can be recycled when disposing
their trash. This results in them choosing not to recycle because of the
additional effort required for research, resulting in low recycling rates.</p>
<h4>Bad Example</h4>
<p>Singaporeans find it too troublesome to recycle. Recycling bins are also
not accessible to all residential areas. Creating a central portal will
help make the recycling process easier.</p>

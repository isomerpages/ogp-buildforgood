<h4>3 Things Your Problem Statement Should Have</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Background and context of the problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People affected by the problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The impact of the problem</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Tips for writing</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Do not include solutions in your problem statement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be concrete</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be brief</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Good Example</h4>
<p>Elderly people lack a support system in their old age. This results in
social isolation and loneliness because they lose contact with their families
or their families die out, and no friends or community members are available
to step in to help.</p>
<h4>Bad Example</h4>
<p>Elderly people lack a support system in their old age. Making the elderly
participate in activities within their Community Centres will help them
forge friendships and create human connections with others.</p>

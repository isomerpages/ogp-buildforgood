### Can I sign up if I don’t have a tech background?

While tech expertise and interest in tech are preferred, we welcome participants from all backgrounds to join us. We do require the solution to be tech-based and recommend that your hackathon team consists of members with the skills required to build the solution. 

### Can I participate as a builder if I’m not in Singapore?

Unfortunately, no. You have to be in Singapore to participate in our in-person sessions and the finale. 

### Can I participate as a startup?
You are free to join as a startup team, but you should be presenting a new solution that was built during the hackathon month at the finale. To ensure fairness, teams are not allowed to bring in an existing solution that was built before the hackathon. Should we find that the solution was already built or commercialised before the hackathon, the organising committee has the right to request for the team to pivot to a new solution or withdraw from the hackathon.

### Can I participate if I’m working or schooling?

Yes! We welcome students or working professionals aged 18 years old and above.

### Must I be a Singaporean to join Build for Good?

Citizens, PRs or foreigners studying or working in Singapore are welcome to join Build for Good.

### Must I join as a builder to contribute to Build for Good?

While builders are essential to Build for Good, we welcome you to contribute in different ways! 

If you have a problem statement to share and challenge our builders to work on them, you can submit them [here](/submit-problems). You may also represent your NGO or a social enterprise to contribute problem statements.

### Do I need a team to participate?

You may sign up as an individual or as a team. You will be given time to get to know fellow builders and form teams at the kickoff. Each team should consist of 3-5 builders, and we strongly encourage teams to have a good mix of builders with different skillsets and background.


### What can we expect during the weekly sessions?
At the sessions, you can expect workshops and talks led by OGP officers and industry experts. Additionally, dedicated spaces will be provided for you to collaborate with your team, seek guidance from mentors, and consult experts.

### What’s the commitment level like?

During the hackathon, there will be compulsory in-person sessions (refer [here](/bfg2024/)here for dates and timing).

These in-person sessions are compulsory to attend and will ensure that you make steady progress towards the finale. Beyond the hackathon, winning teams will be required to take part in a 2-month accelerator programme, which will help them launch their solutions to real users.

### Does my registration guarantee my participation in Build for Good?

After registration, we will be screening through the applications and shortlist participants. This is to ensure that the opportunity is given to people who have the ability to commit and the drive to do public good. We will send you an email regarding your application results by the end of July.

### What do I need to deliver by the end of Build for Good?

All solutions need to have a demonstrated working prototype that's validated through user testing. At the finale, you will be required to outline the problem you identified and how your solution tackles it. All solutions will be evaluated by a judging panel comprising of government leaders and industry experts, and winning teams will be awarded funding of up to $20,000 each.

### What happens after the finale?
Winning teams will receive funding of up to $20,000 and go through a 2-month accelerator programme to continue developing prototypes into full-fledged products. The remaining teams will have full ownership of their products and are encouraged to further develop their products in their own time.

All builders will also be given a digital certificate of participation after the finale.

### Can I sign up if I don’t have a tech background?

While tech expertise and interest in tech are preferred, we welcome participants from all backgrounds to join us. We do recommend however that your hackathon team consists of members with the skills required to build the solution you want to make. 

### Can I participate if I’m not in Singapore?

We strongly encourage you to be in Singapore to participate in our 5 in-person sessions held on 18 May, 25 May, 1 June, 8 June and 15 June. Beyond that, you may find a suitable arrangement with your team so that you can contribute meaningfully during the course of the hackathon.

### Can I participate if I’m working or schooling?

Yes! We welcome students or working professionals aged 18 years old and above.

### Must I be a Singaporean to join Build for Good?

Citizens, PRs or those studying or working in Singapore are welcome to join Build for Good.

### Must I join as a builder to contribute to Build for Good?

While builders are essential to Build for Good, we welcome you to contribute in different ways! If you have a problem statement to share and challenge our builders to work on them, you can submit them [here](https://go.gov.sg/buildforgood-ps). You may also represent your NGO or a social enterprise to contribute problem statements.

### Do I need a team to participate?

You may sign up as an individual or as a team. During the course of the hackathon, you will get the chance to network with one another and form teams of 2 to 5. 


### What’s the commitment level like?

During the hackathon, there will be in-person sessions held every Saturday:

*  **Builders’ Kickoff:** 18 May

*  **Finale:** 22 June

These in-person sessions are compulsory to attend and will ensure that you make steady progress towards the finale. Beyond the hackathon, winning teams will be required to take part in a 2-month accelerator programme, which will help them potentially launch their solutions to real users.

### Does my registration guarantee my participation in Build for Good?

After registration, we will be screening through the applications and shortlist participants. This is to ensure that the opportunity is given to people who have the ability to commit and the drive to do public good. We will send you an email regarding your application results by the end of April.

### What do I need to deliver by the end of Build for Good?

All solutions need to have a demonstrated prototype that's validated through user testing. At the finale, you will be required to outline the problem you identified and how your solution tackles it. All solutions will be evaluated by a judging panel comprising of government leaders and industry experts, and 3 winning teams will be awarded sponsorship of up to $100,000 each.

### What happens after the finale?
All teams will continue to have full ownership (including IP rights) of their prototypes after finale. Winning teams will receive sponsorship and go through a 2-month accelerator programme to continue developing prototypes into full-fledged products. 

All builders will also be given a digital certificate of participation after the finale.

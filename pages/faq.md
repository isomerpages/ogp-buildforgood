Citizens, PRs or those studying or working in Singapore are welcome to join Build for Good.

### Must I join as a builder to contribute to Build for Good?

While builders are essential to Build for Good, we welcome you to contribute in different ways! If you have a problem statement to share and challenge our builders to work on them, you can submit them [here](https://go.gov.sg/buildforgood-ps). You may also represent your NGO or a social enterprise to contribute problem statements.

### Do I need a team to participate?

We encourage you to sign up in teams. However, if you don’t have a team, you can indicate in the sign up form and we will group you with others who don’t have a team too.


### What’s the commitment level like?

During the month-long hackathon from 3 June to 1 July 2023, there will be in-person sessions held every Saturday:

* 3 Jun - Builders' Kickoff
* 10 Jun - Weekly session: Prototyping
* 17 Jun - Weekly session: User testing
* 24 Jun - Weekly session: Iterating & Pitching
* 1 Jul - Finale

The 3 weekly sessions on 10, 17 and 24 June aim to provide updates on the teams' progress, attend workshops or talks, and receive mentoring. These in-person sessions are compulsory to attend and will ensure that you make steady progress towards the finale.

### Does my registration guarantee my participation in Build for Good?

No. We will be screening through the applications and shortlist up 50 participants. This is to ensure that the opportunity is given to people who have the ability to commit and the drive to do public good.

### What do I need to deliver by the end of Build for Good?

All solutions need to have a demonstrated prototype that's validated through user testing. You will be required to deliver a short pitch outlining the problem you identified and how your solution tackles it.

### What happens after the finale?
Winning teams will be provided sponsorship of up to $10,000 each. All teams will have full ownership of their projects and they can decide whether to continue working on them after the finale. 

You will also be given a digital certificate of participation after the finale.

### Can I sign up if I don’t have a tech background?

While tech expertise and interest in tech are preferred, we welcome participants from all backgrounds to join us.

### Must I join as a builder to contribute to Build for Good?

While builders are essential to Build for Good, we welcome you to contribute in different ways! If you have a problem statement to share and challenge our builders to work on them, you can submit them here (insert link).

If you are a member of an NGO or a social enterprise who would like to contribute problem statements or provide domain expertise in the issues that you are familiar, do get in touch with us here (insert email address).

### What kind of problems can I submit?

It can be any problem that you believe Singapore and its residents are facing. Example of problem domains includes education, environment, housing, public health, and wellbeing. You are free to explore any other domain which you feel strongly about (or get some inspirations [here](https://newnaratif.com/the-23-most-important-issues-facing-singapore-in-2022/)).

While defining your problem statement, try to be concrete in defining the who, why, what, where, when and how (5W1H) of the problem. You should also consider the scale of impact of your problem.

### What type of solutions can I come up with?

We welcome all kinds of solutions as long as they effectively address the problem that you have identified, and validated through user testing. However, the solutions should be concrete and actionable so that you can develop and implement them after Build for Good.

### Can I participate if I’m working or schooling?

### What’s the commitment level like?

This ensures that all teams make steady progress in ideating, building prototypes, conduct user research and testing.

### Does my registration guarantee my participation in Build for Good?

### What do I need to deliver by the end of Build for Good?

All solutions need to have demonstrated

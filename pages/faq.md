### Can I sign up if I don’t have a tech background?

While tech expertise and interest in tech are preferred, we welcome participants from all backgrounds to join us.

### Must I join as a builder to contribute to Build for Good?

While builders are essential to Build for Good, we welcome you to contribute in different ways! If you have a problem statement to share and challenge our builders to work on them, you can submit them [here](/problems).

If you are a member of an NGO or a social enterprise who would like to contribute problem statements or provide domain expertise in the issues that you are familiar, do get in touch with us [here](/contact-us).

### Do I need a team to participate?

We encourage you to sign up in teams. However, if you don’t have a team, you can indicate in the sign up form and we will group you with others who don’t have a team too.

### Can I participate if I’m not in Singapore?

We strongly encourage you to be in Singapore throughout the course of Build for Good so that you can participate meaningfully in our in-person events and workshops.

### Can I participate if I’m working or schooling?

Yes! We welcome students or working professionals aged 18 years old and above.

### What’s the commitment level like?

Apart from a kickoff and finale session, there will be 3 weekly sessions (3-hour sessions, once a week) held for teams to provide updates, attend workshops or talks, receive mentoring and participate in product clinics. This ensures that all teams make steady progress in ideating, building prototypes, conduct user research and testing.

### Does my registration guarantee my participation in Build for Good?

No. We will be screening through the applications and shortlist 50 participants. This is to ensure that the opportunity is given to people who have the ability to commit and the drive to do public good.

### What do I need to deliver by the end of Build for Good?

All solutions need to have a demonstrated prototype that's backed up by user testing. You will be required to deliver a short pitch outlining the problem you identified and how your solution tackles it.

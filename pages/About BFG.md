## **About Build for Good**

Build for Good is a month-long hackathon organised by [Open Government Products](open.gov.sg) for citizens to build solutions that tackle public good problems in Singapore. Throughout the month, participating teams will pick a problem of their choice, identify solutions, build prototypes, and test them with users. They will be provided the necessary support through their journey — be it domain expert advice, mentorship, workshops, or resources.

At the end of the month, teams will present their solutions to government leaders and citizens at the finale, and selected projects will receive funding to carry on their projects. Teams will take ownership of their projects from start to end and decide whether to carry on their projects beyond the finale. 

## **Why was Build for Good started?**

When citizens encounter public good problems in their day-to-day lives, they often don’t feel empowered to make changes for the better. Many don’t know how to or feel like they cannot address these problems, especially in areas that have been traditionally seen as part of the government’s domain. Even though many Singaporeans have the skills, desire, and capacity to contribute to public good, they don’t get to use them to make Singapore better, which results in a lot of untapped public good potential.

Through Build for Good, we hope to empower citizens with good ideas to lead the change in making Singapore better. We envision a Singapore where in 5 years, citizens feel like the government is a part of their community, where they feel emboldened to make Singapore better, and where there are various modalities for everyday Singaporeans to contribute to public good.

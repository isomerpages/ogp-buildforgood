## **About Build for Good**

Build for Good is a month-long hackathon organised by [Open Government Products](open.gov.sg) for citizens to build solutions that tackle public good problems in Singapore. Throughout the month, participating teams will pick a problem of their choice, identify solutions, build prototypes, and test them with users. They will be provided the necessary support through their journey — be it domain expert advice, mentorship, workshops, or resources.

At the end of the month, teams will present their solutions to government leaders and citizens at the finale, and selected projects will receive funding to carry on their projects. Teams will take ownership of their projects from start to end and decide whether to carry on their projects beyond the finale. 

## **Why was Build for Good started?**

We observed that when citizens encounter public good problems in their day-to-day lives, they often feel like they cannot address these problems, especially in areas traditionally seen as part of the government’s domain. Even though many Singaporeans have the skills, desire, and capacity to contribute to the public good, they may lack the support or resources to do so, which results in a lot of untapped potential.

Through Build for Good, we hope to empower citizens with good ideas to lead the change in making Singapore better.

We envision a Singapore where in 5 years, citizens feel emboldened to make Singapore better, and where there are various modalities for everyday Singaporeans to contribute to the public good.

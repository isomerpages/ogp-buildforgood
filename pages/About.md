Build for Good is a one-month long hackathon for citizens to build solutions to tackle public good problems in Singapore. Through the month, participating teams will scope out problem statements, identify solutions, build prototypes and test them with users. At the end of the month, they will present their solutions to government leaders and selected teams will receive funding to carry on their projects.

Through Build for Good, we hope to be able to adopt a bottom-up approach to empower citizens to lead the change in making Singapore better.

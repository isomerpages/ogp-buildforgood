### About the team

![](/images/safe%20space.jpeg)

Hi there! We are Team SafeSpace, a group of SMU students passionate about using technology to build products/software solutions that provide meaning, are beneficial, and ultimately have a positive impact on its users.

### Problem Statement

There is a significant amount of friction for youths seeking mental health support as they are bombarded by copious amounts of information online when searching for resources.

### Proposed Solution

To create a one-stop Telegram bot for youths seeking mental health-related assistance. Through a series of relevant questions, we will use zero-knowledge proofs to match them accordingly to a relevant befriender (counsellor or volunteer). In this safe space, they will embark on their mental health journey as they interact with their counsellor/volunteer.

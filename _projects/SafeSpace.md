Hi there! We are Team SafeSpace, a group of SMU students passionate about using technology to build products/software solutions that provide meaning, are beneficial, and ultimately have a positive impact on its users.

### Problem Statement

There is a significant amount of friction for youths when seeking for mental health support, this hinders them from receiving the adequate support that they require.

### Proposed Solution

To create a one-stop Telegram Bot for youths seeking peer service support. Through a series of relevant questions, we will use zero-knowledge proofs in our matching algorithm to connect individuals with similar mental health concerns together. In this safe space, they will be able to communicate and interact with one another anonymously, allowing them to find relief and solace through understanding and empathizing with one another.

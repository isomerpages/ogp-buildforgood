### About the team

Hi there! We are Team SafeSpace, a group of SMU students who are passionate about using technology to build products/software solutions that provide meaning, benefits and a positive impact on its users.

### Problem Statement

There is a great amount of friction when youths try to seek mental health assistance, due to being bombarded by copious amounts of information online when searching for help.

### Proposed Solution

To be a one-stop telegram bot for youths seeking mental health-related assistance. Through a series of relevant questions, using zero-knowledge proofs we will match them accordingly to a relevant befriender (counsellor or volunteer), where in this safe space they will embark on their mental health journey as they interact with their counsellor/volunteer.

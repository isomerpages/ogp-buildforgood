### About the team

![](/images/closed%20anarchy%20products%20large.jpeg)

Hi, we are Closed Anarchy Products! We hope to bridge the gap by providing an online platform where users can connect with others who share similar experiences and receive support from an AI chatbox that acts as a therapist 24/7, anytime and anywhere.

### Problem Statement

In Singapore, there is a growing need for a support group where individuals can openly express their feelings and find solace in a community. 

Many Singaporeans experience loneliness and isolation, yearning for a safe and supportive environment to share their emotions and seek guidance, as they often feel overwhelmed and unable to cope on their own.

### Proposed Solution

We intend to create a platform that offers individuals a space to discover understanding, empathy, and guidance, ultimately fostering enhanced mental well-being. 

The core idea behind this initiative is to empower users to share their concerns with an AI therapist, while also connecting them with like-minded individuals who have gone through similar experiences.

By providing this supportive network, we aim to promote emotional healing and personal growth for all who engage with our platform.

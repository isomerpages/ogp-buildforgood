### About the team

![](/images/msteam.jpeg)

We are team MS (Hanh, Wen Yu and Catherine). We were ex-colleagues in a company called guess what, MS. We really enjoyed working with each other last time (well, most of the time). So apart from contributing ideas for public good, we came to BFG to relive the good old days.


### Problem Statement

A wheelchaired resident missed his doctor appointment due to not being aware of lift maintenance. A stay-at-home mom with an infant needed to make last-minute arrangements because she didn’t know about demolition work upstairs.

Everyday, changes in our neighbouring area affect residents’ day-to-day lives. However, some affected residents are not aware of those changes’ announcements in advance. Hence, they are unable to make timely decisions to minimise interruptions to their lives.

### Proposed Solution

We identified 3 groups of residents that get affected the most by residential area changes. They are (1) caregivers and their dependents due to limited mobility (e.g. wheelchaired parent, young infant), (2) homebound residents due to lifestyle/career choices (e.g. retirees, work-from-home professionals), and (3) non-homebound residents but household decision makers.

For these 3 targetted groups, on top of existing notice boards, we want to offer another channel that allows announcement retrieval more accessible, personalised and easy-to-action-on.

### About the team

Hi there! Weâ€™re Team SustainaBite, a dynamic group of problem solvers determined to address the critical issue of food waste in Singapore. 

Join us in our mission to create a sustainable future for Singapore by tackling food waste, one bite at a time!

### Problem Statement

Food waste + food insecurity. A large amount of food is wasted annually (744 million kg in 2019 as per the 'towardszerowaste' website). 

At the same time, there are individuals who are food insecure, and depend on individuals' generosity for meals. The problem of food waste exists at multiple levels, from individual households, to hawkers/buffets. 

The problem of food insecurity mainly affects the lower income group of the country. Solving this problem would reflect a more efficient use of resources (by reducing waste), while improving the quality of life (depending on the solution, perhaps) of people belonging to food insecure demographics in Singapore.

### Proposed Solution

To provide a platform that offers meal kits with personalised, portioned ingredients sourced directly from wet markets.

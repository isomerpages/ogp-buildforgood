### About the team

Our team is made up of students from NUS, coming from a variety of different majors and backgrounds.

  

### Problem Statement

Singaporeans who already practice recycling want a convenient way to check if an item is recyclable and where they can recycle items. NEA figures show that over half of Singaporeans engage in recycling practices regularly but they lack exhaustive knowledge of what can be recycled or how to dispose of the recyclables properly.

Results from our user survey validates these figures - 65.3% of respondents recycle regularly/occasionally. When asked why they recycle, 83.7% indicated for environmental impact. Our survey also helped us identify 2 main pain points Singaporeans encounter when recycling: they find it hard to locate recycling bins while on-the-go and are unsure of what can be recycled.
  

### Proposed Solution

  
1. An item search/scanner that informs users about the recyclability of an item, provides instructions on how to prepare it for recycling and includes a "Find nearest recycling bin" call-to-action button that leads to the bin locator feature.

2. The recycling bin locator allows users to select the specific item they want to recycle, generating a list of the nearest bins that accept that item. The list is organized based on proximity to the user, accompanied by distance indicators (e.g., 50m) for easy reference.

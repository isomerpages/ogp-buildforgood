### About the team

![](/images/renesan%20large.jpeg)

We‚Äôre a team of NUS students who were connected through friends of friends! Jing Ru is a Product Designer and Jun Hong, Remus, Vijay, and Zechary are all software developers.  
**Fun fact:** Renesan is an AI-generated name! üòã

**Justification:** Renesan is derived from the Latin word ‚Äúrenasci,‚Äù which means ‚Äúto be reborn or renewed.‚Äù The name Renesan is fitting for a business that encourages recycling as it implies the idea of giving new life to old materials. It's also a mash-up of recycling/environment related keywords (Renewable + Sanitation = Renesan)

### Problem Statement

Singaporeans who already practice recycling want a convenient way to check if an item is recyclable and where they can recycle items. NEA figures show that over half of Singaporeans engage in recycling practices but lack exhaustive knowledge of what can be recycled or how to dispose of the recyclables properly.

Results from our user survey validate these figures - 65.3% of respondents recycle regularly/occasionally. When asked why they recycle, 83.7% indicated environmental impact. Our survey also helped us identify two main pain points Singaporeans encounter when recycling: they find it hard to locate recycling bins while on the go and are unsure of what can be recycled.
  

### Proposed Solution

1. An item search/scanner that informs users about the recyclability of an item, provides instructions on how to prepare it for recycling and includes a "Find nearest recycling bin" call-to-action button that leads to the bin locator feature.

2. The recycling bin locator allows users to select the specific item they want to recycle, generating a list of the nearest bins that accept that item. The list is organized based on proximity to the user, accompanied by distance indicators (e.g., 50m) for easy reference.

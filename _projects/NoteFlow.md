### About the team

![](/images/noteflow.jpeg)

We are team Noteflow! Our team members come from diverse backgrounds, bringing a wide range of expertise and perspectives to the table.

We understand the time constraints faced by counsellors, and we're determined to enhance their ability to provide high-quality care to students.

### Problem Statement

School counselors often have busy schedules, handling various responsibilities, such as counseling sessions, meetings, and administrative tasks. Limited time can make it challenging for them to dedicate sufficient attention to documenting case notes which can affect case note documentation and quality of care.  

### Proposed Solution

Our team is developing NoteFlow to help busy school counsellors write comprehensive case notes quicker using a combination of real-time transcription, efficient note synthesis, and responsive querying. 

With NoteFlow, counsellors can bid farewell to lengthy note-taking sessions and say hello to comprehensive case notes in a fraction of the time. Leveraging AI, our platform streamlines the documentation process, allowing counsellors to focus more on what truly mattersâ€” the wellness of their students.

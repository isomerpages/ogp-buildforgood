We are a team of software engineers and UI/UX designers dedicated to improving scam protection for Singaporeans. With our combined expertise, we strive to develop innovative solutions that enhance online safety. The focus is on crafting robust technologies and user-friendly designs to safeguard Singaporeans against scams and ensure a secure digital experience.


### Problem Statement

Protect citizens against QR Code Phishing and Malware Scams. Scams are a severe issue contributing to at least 700M in annual economic losses as of 2022.

Preventing scams is crucial for protecting individuals from financial and emotional harm, safeguarding personal information, preserving trust in institutions, ensuring economic stability, enhancing cybersecurity, complying with legal regulations, and minimizing the psychological impact on victims.

### Proposed Solution

To create digital signatures for public-facing QR codes where we control the QR code scanner app (prevents any hijacking). It allows a closed-loop solution that prevents QR codes from being hijacked and gives consumers the confidence to scan.

### Problem Statement

Some seniors face several hurdles while searching for a job. Firstly, job portals are hard to navigate, especially when most seniors donâ€™t own a laptop. Next, they might not have an email to create an account. Lastly, some of them donâ€™t have resumes. Neither do they know how to create one.

As such, they turn to in-person help. However, this is labour-intensive and can be costly for our social services sector.

Our team asks the question: how might we make it easier for seniors to get a job?
  

### Proposed Solution

We zoned in on resume creation as the first step in making it easier for seniors to get a job. Our proposal: AnÂ AI-powered chatbot to empower seniors with instant resume creation.

The chatbot will gather information from the seniors through a conversation and automatically generates a resume ready to be dropped off at job portals and with potential employers. To enhance accessibility, seniors will be able to use voice instead of typing and also converse in any dialects of their choice.

### Problem Statement

Seniors, particularly those who were not highly educated, face several hurdles while searching for a job.

First, job portals are hard to navigate, especially when most seniors donâ€™t own a laptop.

Second, they do not have an email to create an account.

Third, most of them donâ€™t have resumes. Neither do they know how to create one.

Most seniors turn to in-person help. But that is labour-intensive and costly for our social sector.

So, we thought: how might we make it easier for seniors to get a job?
  

### Proposed Solution

We zoned in on resume creation as the first step in making it easier for seniors to get a job. We want to create anÂ AI-powered chatbot to empower seniors with instant resume creation.The chatbot will gather information from the seniors through a conversation and automatically generates a resume ready to be dropped off at job portals and with potential employers. To enhance accessibility, seniors will be able to use voice instead of typing.

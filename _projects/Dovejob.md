### Problem Statement

Senior citizens in Singapore face several hurdles while searching for a job. Firstly, job portals are hard to navigate. Job portals require a certain level of technical savviness to navigate through. 

Next, even creating an account on the job portals poses a significant hurdle. They sometimes either do not have emails. The ones that do might not remember their password.

Lastly, they might not have a resume or know how to craft an effective one. These factors create hurdles upon hurdles for the aged to apply for jobs. How can we make it easier for them to apply for jobs?
  

### Proposed Solution

The upcoming product will incorporate several key features, including profiling the elderly based on their needs, a filtering and recommendation system, chat-based views of job listings, chat-based application submission, chat-based resume crafting (a much-needed feature for many users), availability in common languages in Singapore, and the provision of templates for employers to create job postings.

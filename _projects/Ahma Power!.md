### About the team

![](/images/ahma%20power.jpg)

Hi everyone! We are team Ahma Power! Since we are working on helping the elderly get jobs, here is a little fun fact about our ideal retirement job.

  

### Problem Statement

The elderly in Singapore face several hurdles while searching for a job.  Firstly, job portals are difficult to navigate. Job portals require a certain level of technical savviness to navigate through. 

Next, even creating an account on the job portals pose as a major hurdle. The elderly sometimes either do not have emails. The ones that do, might not remember their password.

Lastly, they might not have a resume or even have the knowledge on how to craft an effective resume. These factors creates hurdles upon hurdles for the elderly to even apply for a job. How can we make it easier for the elderly to apply for a job?

  

### Proposed Solution

The upcoming product will incorporate several key features, including profiling the elderly based on their needs, a filtering and recommendation system, chat-based views of job listings, chat-based application submission, chat-based resume crafting (a much-needed feature for many users), availability in common languages in Singapore, and the provision of templates for employers to create job postings.

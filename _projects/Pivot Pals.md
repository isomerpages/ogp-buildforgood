### About the team

![](/images/pivot%20pals.jpeg)

Pivot Pals are here to help our fellow career-switchers, to transform what seems like a frustrating journey to one of joy and self-discovery.

Adulting is tough but career switching is so much tougher!

活到老，学到老。(One is never too old to learn)

Most of the team consists career-switchers and job-seekers. We resonate very much with the mental fatigue experienced during transitions. Hence, we would like to provide our fellow career switchers with a safe platform to share, be it small wins or woes, and connect to support each other.

  

### Problem Statement

Uncertainty and self-doubt are consistent emotions that career-switchers experience, with little avenues and safe outlets for sharing the struggle. 

While there are plenty of avenues to seek structured career advice and feedback, one such service is WorkforceSG, the balance of building a supportive and constructive work culture is non-trivial - the limitations surrounding, firstly helping others succeed and secondly, doing so appropriately in the corporate environment through personal sharing, is a seemingly tall order to stay within boundaries in relationships.


### Proposed Solution

Our vision is to let all career-switchers know that they are not alone, and there will be people supporting them in their pursuits throughout this fun yet arduous journey. We want to do this by building a community to connect career-switchers, to support each other throughout the entire process.

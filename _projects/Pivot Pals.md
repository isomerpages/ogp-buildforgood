### About the team

![](/images/pivot%20pals.jpeg)

Pivot Pals are here to help our fellow career-switchers, to transform what seems like a frustrating journey to one of joy and self-discovery.

Adulting is tough but career switching is so much tougher!

活到老，学到老。(One is never too old to learn)

Most of the team consists of career-switchers and job-seekers. We resonate very much with the mental fatigue experienced during transitions. Hence, we would like to provide our fellow career switchers with a safe platform to share, whether small wins or woes and connect to support each other.

*Team members: Hansel Chia Chen Young, Lim Kiat King, Goh Hui Shi Samantha, Lee Weirong, Koh Yan Hao*

### Problem Statement

Uncertainty and self-doubt are consistent emotions that career-switchers experience, with little avenues and safe outlets for sharing the struggle. 

While there are plenty of avenues to seek structured career advice and feedback, the balance of building a supportive and constructive work culture is non-trivial. The limitations surrounding, firstly helping others succeed and secondly, doing so appropriately in the corporate environment through personal sharing, is a seemingly tall order to stay within boundaries in relationships.


### Proposed Solution

Our vision is to let all career-switchers know that they are not alone and people will support them in their pursuits throughout this fun yet arduous journey. We want to do this by building a community that connects people interested in switching careers and receiving the support they need during this process.

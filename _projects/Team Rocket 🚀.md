### About the team

![](/images/team%20rocket.jpeg)

We are Team Rocket. The universe has brought together 4 alumni from Rocket Academy's software engineering bootcamp and an astronaut-level software engineer, all fueled by the desire to build and ship great products. We are super stoked to launch into our problem space and orbit around users!

  

### Problem Statement

Scammers are constantly coming up with new and innovative ways to make their scams look legit. Even young and digitally savvy people are susceptible: those aged 20-39 are the biggest group of victims. Scams cost us $661 million in 2022, terrible for Singapore economically and catastrophic for the victims.

### Proposed Solution
We are developing a ‚ÄúScam-or-Not‚Äù game that tasks users with identifying scams from examples of real scams and legit messages. Our goal is to make users better at detecting scams, while providing data on harder-to-identify scams based on game results, allowing the authorities to concentrate resources on tackling them.

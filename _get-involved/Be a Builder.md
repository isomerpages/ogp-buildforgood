## **What's in it for You**
üë§ **Make an impact** - Solve problems on the ground with beneficiaries and NGOs

üí∞ **Realise your solutions** - Bring your projects to the next level with resources, mentorship and sponsorship

üëÅ **Push for change** - Present your solutions to government leaders and citizens, and shine a light on issues you're passionate about

‚úçÔ∏è **Learning Opportunity** - Upskill yourself through curated engineering, design, and product workshops 

## **Who Can Be a Builder?**
Whether you are a student or a working professional, you are welcome to join us as long as you are **aged 18 and above with a strong desire to make Singapore better**!

You may sign up as a team of 3-5 or as an individual. You will be grouped with other participants if you choose to sign up individually.

Having tech expertise is preferred but not necessary. It's recommended to ensure that your team consists of members with the skills required to build the solution. But not to worry, we have engineering, design, and product workshops to help you along the way!

## **What kind of solutions can I come up with?**
Your solution should be a digital/physical product or service that addresses a chosen public good problem, and it should not be for the purpose of generating profit. 

You will be required to demonstrate a prototype that's backed by user testing at the finale.

If you need inspiration, you can check out the products built at OGP's internal hackathon, [Hack for Public Good](https://hack.gov.sg/2023-prototypes/armoury/).

## **Event Timeline**
Build for Good will run from 3 June to 1 July 2023, with a kickoff, a series of weekly sessions, and a finale event. In between these sessions, builders are free to continue working on the solutions towards the finale. 

Do note that all sessions are on Saturdays, held in-person only, with no virtual option so as to maximise the builders‚Äô experience.

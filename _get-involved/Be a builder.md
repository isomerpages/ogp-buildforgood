### **Why you should be a builder**
* **Make an impact** - Solve problems on the ground with beneficiaries and NGOs

* **Realise your solutions** - Bring your projects to the next level with mentorship and sponsorship

* **Push for change** - Present your solutions to government leaders and industry experts, and shine a light on issues you're passionate about

*  **Learn and grow** - Upskill yourself through curated engineering, design, and product workshops 

### **Who can be a builder?**
Anyone 18 and above with a strong desire to make Singapore better is welcome to sign up to be a builder. Interested builders may join as a team or as individuals, though during the hackathon, all builders will be required to eventually form teams of 2 to 5. You may indicate in the signup form if you want to find your own teammates or if you would like us to match you with potential teammates instead.

Tech expertise is preferred but not necessary to join as a builder. We do recommend however that your hackathon team consists of members with the skills required to build the solution you want to make. We will be hosting networking sessions as well as engineering, design, and product workshops to help you along the way!

### **What kind of solutions can I come up with?**

Your solution should be a digital/physical product or service that addresses a chosen public good problem in Singapore, and it should not be for the purpose of generating profit. 

You will be required to demonstrate a prototype that's backed by user testing at the finale.

If you need inspiration, you can check out the products built at OGP's internal hackathon, [Hack for Public Good](https://hack.gov.sg/2023-prototypes/armoury/).

### **Event Timeline**

Build for Good will run from 3 June to 1 July 2023. The hackathon will consist of a kickoff, a series of weekly sessions, and a finale event. In between these sessions, builders are free to continue working on their projects in their own time.

Do note that all sessions are on Saturdays and held in-person only so as to maximise the builders’ experience. 

*  **Builders’ Kickoff:** 3 June
*  **Weekly session - Prototyping:** 10 June
*  **Weekly session - User testing:** 17 June
*  **Weekly session - Iteration and Pitching:** 24 June
*  **Finale:** 1 July

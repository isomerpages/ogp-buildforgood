### **Why you should be a builder**
* **Make an impact** - Solve problems on the ground with beneficiaries and NGOs

* **Realise your solutions** - Bring your projects to the next level with mentorship and sponsorship

* **Push for change** - Present your solutions to government leaders and citizens, and shine a light on issues you're passionate about

*  **Learn and grow** - Upskill yourself through curated engineering, design, and product workshops 

### **Who can be a builder?**
Whether you are a student or a working professional, you are welcome to join us as long as you are **aged 18 and above with a strong desire to make Singapore better**!

You may sign up as a team or as an individual. During the hackathon, all builders will require to network with one another and form teams of 2 to 5. You may indicate in the signup form if you will find your own team mates or you would like us to match potential team mates for you.

Having tech expertise is preferred but not necessary. It's recommended to ensure that your team consists of members with the skills required to build the solution. But not to worry, we have engineering, design, and product workshops to help you along the way!

### **What kind of solutions can I come up with?**
Your solution should be a digital/physical product or service that addresses a chosen problem that people are facing in Singapore, and it should not be for the purpose of generating profit. 

You will be required to demonstrate a prototype that's backed by user testing at the finale.

If you need inspiration, you can check out the products built at OGP's internal hackathon, [Hack for Public Good](https://hack.gov.sg/2023-prototypes/armoury/).

### **Event Timeline**
Build for Good will run from 3 June to 1 July 2023 with a kickoff, a series of weekly sessions, and a finale event. In between these sessions, builders are free to continue working on the solutions towards the finale. 

Do note that all sessions are on Saturdays and held in-person only so as to maximise the builders’ experience. 

*  **Builders’ Kickoff:** 3 June
*  **Weekly session - Prototyping:** 10 June
*  **Weekly session - User testing:** 17 June
*  **Weekly session - Iteration and Pitching:** 24 June

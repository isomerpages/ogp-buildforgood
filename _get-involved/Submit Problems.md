### **Face a problem which you feel strongly about? Share them with us and our builders!**
This can be any problem that you believe Singapore and its residents are facing. Example of problem domains include education, environment, housing, public health, and wellbeing. You are free to explore any other domain which you feel strongly about (or get some inspirations&nbsp;[here](https://newnaratif.com/the-23-most-important-issues-facing-singapore-in-2022/)).

While defining your problem statement, try to be concrete in defining the who, why, what, where, when and how (5W1H) of the problem. You should also consider the scale of impact of your problem.

Here are some example of problem statements which came up at our [previous hackathon](https://hack.gov.sg/2023-prototypes/armoury/):
* Patients are forced to be present to register and queue at GPs/PHIs. Clinics are having trouble manually managing walk-ins &amp; appointments every day.
* Members of the public are unable to identify scam websites effectively, and often fall prey to scams by sharing personal details.
* Singapore generated 1.82 million tonnes of domestic waste in 2021, and is stuck in a ‘buy-throw’ rather than ‘donate-reuse’ cycle. This is partly due to high coordination overheads to donate/source good quality items.

### **Face a problem which you feel strongly about? Share them with us and our builders!**
This can be any problem that you believe Singapore and its residents are facing. Example of problem domains include education, environment, housing, public health, and wellbeing. You are free to explore any other domain which you feel strongly about (or get some inspirations&nbsp;[here](https://newnaratif.com/the-23-most-important-issues-facing-singapore-in-2022/)).

While defining your problem statement, try to be concrete in defining the who, why, what, where, when and how (5W1H) of the problem. You should also consider the scale of impact of your problem.

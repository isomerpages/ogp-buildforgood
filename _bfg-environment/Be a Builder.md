<p>We are back with another round of Build for Good, but this time, we are
partnering with the <a href="https://www.mse.gov.sg/sgecofund/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment's SG Eco Fund</a> to
zoom in on the environment!
<br>
<br>Join us to build solutions that tackle environmental issues that you’re
passionate about, be it food waste, recycling, climate change, and more.</p>
<h3><strong>Why you should be a Builder?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Build solutions that tackle real environmental problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deepen your understanding of the environmental sector</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receive mentorship from tech &amp; environmental experts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Present your solutions to government leaders and industry experts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Winning teams will receive funding of up to S$100,000* and take part in
a 2-month accelerator program to further develop their solutions, and potentially
launch them to real users!

<h3><strong>Who can be a Builder?</strong></h3>
<p>Anyone 18 and above with a strong desire to make Singapore better is welcome
to sign up to be a builder. Applicants may join as a team or as individuals,
though during the hackathon, all Builders will be required to eventually
form teams of 3 to 5.</p>
<p>Here are the 4 core attributes which we use to assess the applications:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Commitment: Is the applicant able to commit for all weekly sessions, and
willing to continue working on the solution beyond the hackathon?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initiative: Has the applicant demonstrated that he/she has thought through
the problem space, and even proposed possible solutions to the problem?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Values: Are there any past projects / involvement that demonstrates individual's
commitment to the public good?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abilities: What's the level of technical expertise the participant has
in his/her own field?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>What kind of solutions can I come up with?</strong></h3>
<p>Your solution should be a digital/physical product or service that addresses
an environmental problem in Singapore, and it should not be for the purpose
of generating profit.</p>
<p>You will be required to demonstrate a prototype that's backed by user
testing at the finale.</p>
<p>If you need inspiration, you can check out the <a href="/projects/basecamp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">projects</a> from our last Build for Good!</p>
<h3><strong>Event Timeline</strong></h3>
<p>The hackathon will run from 18 May to 22 June 2024, which consists of
a kickoff, 4 weekly sessions, and a finale event. In between these sessions,
Builders are free to continue working on their projects in their own time.
We will provide working spaces on Thursdays to allow teams to work on their
projects.</p>
<p>Do note that all sessions are on Saturdays and held in-person only so
as to maximise the Builders’ experience.</p>

<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Despite a significant investment of $800,000 over 9 years, a local fish
farm struggles to turn a profit. The owner faces a major challenge: feed
costs account for over 50% of their operating expenses.
<br>
<br>In an attempt to reduce expenses, the farm experimented with feeding their
fish upcycled food waste like bread, soy press, rice bran, and maggi. While
this approach lowered feed costs, it resulted in a high Feed Conversion
Ratio (FCR). This means the fish grew slowly, further hindering profitability.</p>

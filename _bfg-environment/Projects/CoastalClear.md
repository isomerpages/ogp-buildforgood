<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Coastal marine waste is a growing problem, particularly evident during
the monsoon seasons. Since monitoring began by the NEA in 2019, the amount
of marine waste collected has increased by 11%. In 2021, the NEA collected
4 million kg of flotsam from 10 beaches and coastlines across the island,
excluding the litter collected by volunteer groups. Despite the NEA increasing
the frequency of their cleaning operations from four times a week to twice
daily, it is not possible to eliminate marine litter on our shores entirely.
Therefore, there is a co-dependency on various volunteering and community
groups to help keep our coasts clean.
<br>
<br>User research with these volunteer groups revealed that the lack of visibility
regarding the cleanliness of coastal areas is a persistent challenge, impacting
the effectiveness and efficiency of their cleanups. This results in clean-up
conflicts between groups, traveling to relatively clean areas instead of
litter hotspots and over/under-allocating manpower for clean-ups, all of
which diminish the impact of the volunteer work done.
<br>
<br>When marine litter is not effectively disposed, it poses serious ecological
and public health challenges. Plastics, which make up nearly 90% of marine
litter, degrade into microplastics, posing a lethal risk to marine animals.
For example, sea turtles often mistake floating plastic bags for jellyfish,
leading to ingestion and potential death. Birds and other marine creatures
are similarly affected, leading to a decrease in biodiversity and disruption
of marine ecosystems. Humans are also adversely affected by marine litter.
For instance, NUS marine scientists found toxic bacteria living on the
surfaces of microplastics collected from the coastal areas of Singapore
that are capable of causing infections in humans.</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p>Our mission is to leverage technology to amplify the impact of voluntary
efforts. We want to empower the volunteering community to improve the efficiency
&amp; effectiveness of coastal cleanups. Our solution is a predictive analytical
and location booking tool that provides better guidance to volunteers on
where rubbish will land, what areas need more frequent cleaning and what
areas have been cleaned to ensure volunteering resources are bring directed
to the spaces that need it the most!</p>

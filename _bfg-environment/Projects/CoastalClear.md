<p>We're a group of sustainability enthusiasts from diverse fields and backgrounds,
united by our common passion to tackle the issue of coastal waste on our
beautiful island home!</p>
<p><strong>Team members: </strong>Krithika Prasad (Product), Emmanuel Oh
(Software Engineer), Tan Eu Zin (Software Engineer), Shawn (Designer),
Vaelyn (Strategy)</p>
<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>We are addressing the lack of visibility of marine litter in our coastal
areas, which is critical to supporting the clean-up efforts undertaken
by volunteering organizations.
<br>
<br>This is a growing problem as evidenced by NEA &amp; our user research.
Based on data published by the NEA since 2019, the amount of marine waste
collected has increased by 11%. Although NEA collected 4 million kg of
waste from 10 beaches, this excludes hidden hotspots that may be missed
(such as mangroves or less popular coastal areas). Despite NEA increasing
coastal cleaning frequency from 4 times a week to twice daily, the problem
persists and there is a dependency on local volunteer and community groups
to support coastal cleanup efforts. User research conducted by the team
with 10 volunteer groups revealed a persistent problem that impeded the
effectiveness of their cleanups: the lack of visibility into the level
of cleanliness of our coastal areas. This leads to redundant efforts as
a result of organizing a cleanup in a recently cleaned areas, an inability
to match volunteer cleanup efforts to trash hotspots and improper/ inefficient
manpower allocation
<br>
<br>This is an important problem to solve because of the mounting environmental
impact on our marine biodiversity and significant public health risks to
Singaporeans. Ineffective clean-ups mean that marine trash, mostly composed
of plastic, degrades into microplastics on our shores. Marine animals ingest
them, mistaking them for food. Toxic bacteria thrive on them, damaging
ecosystems and causing infections in humans. In a 2019 study carried out
by NUS marine scientists, toxic bacteria was found on the microplastics
scattered around Singapore's coastlines capable of causing coral bleaching
and triggering wound infections in humans.</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p>Our mission is to leverage technology to amplify the impact of voluntary
efforts. We want to empower the volunteering community to improve the efficiency
&amp; effectiveness of coastal cleanups. Our solution is a predictive analytical
and location booking tool that provides better guidance to volunteers on
where rubbish will land, what areas need more frequent cleaning and what
areas have been cleaned to ensure volunteering resources are bring directed
to the spaces that need it the most!</p>

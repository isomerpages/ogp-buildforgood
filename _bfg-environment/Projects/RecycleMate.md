<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>As of 2022, Singapore's recycling rate is 57%, falling short of the 2030
target of 70% (NEA). Despite increasing environmental awareness, many consumers
struggle with proper recycling due to confusion about recyclable materials
and varying guidelines. This leads to contaminated recycling streams and
increased waste.
<br>
<br>Traditional educational methods have proven insufficient. Our user survey
revealed that although 77.3% of respondents recycle regularly (at least
once a month), they encounter two major challenges: 68.2% feel they lack
adequate information on what can be recycled, and 63.6% are confused about
proper recycling procedures.</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p>RecycleMate is a mobile app designed to simplify and enhance recycling
practices in Singapore. Our app provides users with easy access to micro-recyclers
and simplifies the identification of recyclable items.
<br>
<br>Users can use our in bulit image recognition to easily check if an item
is recyclable by breaking it down into its constitutent waste streams.

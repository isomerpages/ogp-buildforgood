<p>Over here at The Recyclable Network, we consist of teammates from various
walks of life, united by a common goal: achieving a zero-waste, circular
future. Fun Fact: Our team name, RecycleMate, is inspired by our goal to

<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>As of 2022, Singapore's recycling rate is 57%, falling short of the 2030
target of 70% (NEA). Despite increasing environmental awareness, many consumers
struggle with proper recycling due to confusion about recyclable materials
and varying guidelines. This leads to contaminated recycling streams and
increased waste.
<br>
<br>Traditional educational methods have proven insufficient. Our user survey
revealed that although 77.3% of respondents recycle regularly (at least
once a month), they encounter two major challenges: 68.2% feel they lack
adequate information on what can be recycled, and 63.6% are confused about
proper recycling procedures.</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p>RecycleMate is a mobile app designed to simplify and enhance recycling
practices in Singapore. Our app offers:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Item Identification: Users can use our in bulit image recognition to easily
check if an item is recyclable by breaking it down into its constitutent
waste streams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Location Services: The app provides information on the nearest recycling
bins, helping users locate them effortlessly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educational Content: Comprehensive guidelines and tips on proper recycling
practices to reduce contamination and confusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User Engagement: Features such as notifications, recycling tips, and community
forums to encourage active participation in recycling.

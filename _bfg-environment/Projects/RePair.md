<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>One Singaporean generates 73 mobile phones worth of e-waste a year, but
only 5.5% of this e-waste is recycled. These low recycling rates may be
caused as many Singaporeans fail to see the visible impact of their efforts
when they go out of their way to practice proper e-waste disposal. This
causes a lack of drive to support the countryâ€™s e-waste recycling efforts.</p>

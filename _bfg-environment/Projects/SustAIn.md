<p>We are team Fansipan, which is simply the name of the mountain where one
of our team members was on when we were accepted to the hackathon. We are
a team of four spontaneous software engineers wanting to challenge ourselves
and utilise our skills to contribute to public good.</p>
<p><strong>Team members: </strong>Ang Zhen Yi, Orlin Romy, Chen Zhenhao,
Lim Xuan Hao</p>
<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Many individuals struggle to identify and implement effective sustainability
measures in their homes, often due to lack of knowledge about the specific
actions they can take and the impact of these actions on their carbon footprint.
<br>
<br>A survey conducted in December 2023 found that 46 percent of Singapore
respondents had adopted Sustainable consumption practices when purchasing
items in the last 12 months, while about 23 percent were unsure if they
had adopted any sustainable practices.</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p>A green home consultant app where users can upload pictures of their homes
and get actionable, personalised recommendations on how to make their living
spaces more sustainable. Key features include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Energy/water-efficient product recommendations that can be bought using
Climate Vouchers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suggestions for more environmentally conscious lifestyle habits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding and tracking goals set based on the recommendations</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Environment Impact Analysis involves identification of wildlife species
in a given area.
<br>
<br>Camera trap data is expensive to produce and difficult to classify. Smaller
organisations lack the resources and infrastructure needed for video data
classification.
<br>
<br>Moreove, audio data is comparatively inexpensive and easier to set up,
however, there is a lack of classifcation tools for audio data, and there
is a growing need for such data to be processed.

<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>In recent years, despite increased awareness and education about environmental
and public health issues, there remains a significant lapse in public hygiene
practices locally. Studies indicate that such negligence not only stems
from a lack of awareness but also from behavioral fatigue, perceived ineffectiveness
of efforts, and insufficient public infrastructure. For instance, a survey
shows 85% of littering behavior was the result of individual attitudes
towards littering, suggesting a deep-seated issue of personal responsibility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted challenges in maintaining
public hygiene, with compliance to hand hygiene protocols still below 50%
in many public areas, according to the World Health Organization. This
persistent issue of public hygiene negligence poses serious risks to environmental
sustainability and public health, necessitating a multi-faceted approach
to foster a stronger communal responsibility and enhance infrastructural
support.</p>

<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Singapore has a growing littering problem, although Singaporeans would
never think of it given our reputation of being one of the cleanest &amp;
safest cities in the world. In 2019, Singapore had 70,000 cleaners for
a population of 5 million, a significantly higher cleaner-to-resident ration
than most other countries of similar size and scale suggesting we have
become over-reliant on cleaners to clean up after us. The average cleaner
age is 60 &amp; trying to solve this by continually importing a foreign
workforce is not a sustainable or long-term solution to this issue.

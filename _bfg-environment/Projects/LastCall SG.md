<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Food waste is a critical global issue, with millions of tons of food discarded
annually despite being fit for consumption. This wastage occurs at various
stages of the supply chain, including production, distribution, and retail.
While efforts have been made to address food waste in traditional brick-and-mortar
retail settings, there is a lack of initiatives to help online food and
beverage (F&amp;B) merchants better manage waste.
<br>
<br>The rise of e-commerce has been remarkable, with online retail sales now
accounting for nearly 11.2% of total retail sales, driven by the convenience
and popularity of online shopping platforms. Platform such as Shopee have
over 500,000 SKUs listed in the F&amp;B category. As more consumers embrace
the convenience of online grocery shopping, the issue of food waste in
this sector becomes increasingly pressing.
<br>
<br>A considerable portion of food waste in online retail comprises excess
inventory, items nearing expiration, blemished produce, and products rejected
for minor defects. These items, while still being fit for consumption,
contribute significantly to the food waste problem. Addressing this issue
requires innovative solutions tailored to the unique challenges faced by
online F&amp;B merchants.
<br>
<br>Our team proposes to focus on this niche area, developing strategies and
tools to help online F&amp;B merchants better reduce waste, and promote
sustainability.</p>

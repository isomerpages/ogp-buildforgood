<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Singapore's recycling rate of 57 percent as of 2022, is still short of
the 2030 target of 70 percent. (NEA)
<br>
<br>Despite growing environmental awareness, many consumers struggle with
proper recycling due to confusion about recyclable materials and varying
guidelines, leading to contaminated recycling streams and increased waste.
Traditional educational methods have been proven to be insufficient, highlighting
the need for an innovative solution

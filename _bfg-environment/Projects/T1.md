<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>In Singapore, recycling bin contamination poses a significant challenge
to effective waste management and recycling efforts. Despite the presence
of dedicated recycling bins (Bloobin), a large proportion of non-recyclable
materials, such as food waste, electronic waste, and non-recyclable plastics,
often end up in these bins. It has been shown that 7 in 10 households recycle
regularly but half of them mistake non recyclables for recyclables and
7 in 10 are unsure of what materials can be recycled. This shows that while
the public has the good intention to recycle, they are not well equipped
with the knowledge to recycle right.</p>
<p>To shed some light into this, 40% of items placed in blue recycling bins
are contaminated and cannot be recycled putting everyoneâ€™s recycling effort
to waste. This contamination not only hampers the recycling process but
also increases the cost and complexity of waste sorting and disposal, ultimately
reducing the overall efficiency of recycling programs. Addressing this
issue requires heightened public awareness through innovative solutions
to reduce such occurrences.</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p>To tackle the issue of recycling bin contamination in Singapore, we propose
an AI-powered chatbot solution that leverages computer vision and a large
language model to guide users on proper recycling practices. This chatbot
will allow users to input images or general queries of waste items, which
it will analyze to differentiate between recyclable and non-recyclable
materials, subsequently providing clear instructions on correct disposal
methods.</p>
<p>Additionally, the chatbot will serve as an educational tool, offering
information on recycling contamination and the sorting process, and assisting
users with recycling-related queries. By enhancing public awareness and
equipping individuals with the necessary knowledge to recycle correctly,
we aim to significantly reduce contamination rates in recycling bins, improving
the overall efficiency and effectiveness of Singapore's recycling programs.</p>

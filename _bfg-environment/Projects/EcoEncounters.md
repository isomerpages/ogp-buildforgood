<p>Hi! We're Team Kreta and we're grateful to be part of this hackathon.
We're ready to learn and stretch our creative muscles as we develop a product
people love! See you around :)</p>
<p><strong>Team members: </strong>Nysha Tan (Design/Product), Kianne Lim
(Design/Product), Lin Zhenming (Product/Software Engineer), Srushti Ganesh

<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Singapore residents find it difficult to coexist with wildlife. By 2030,
the goal is to have 9 in 10 homes within 400m of a park. Yet, local residents
are intolerant of wildlife due to low childhood nature experiences (Ngo
et al. 2022) and remain having little to no knowledge on wildlife etiquette
(ACRES, 2024).
<br>
<br>Intolerance instances manifest as mounting complaints to Town Council
who are pressured into unnecessary culling of wildlife. In 2023, NParks
received nearly 15,000 cases of pigeon-related feedback while the Government
received about 2,500 cases of monkey-related feedback. ACRES also handled
990 human-wildlife conflict cases.
<br>
<br>Currently, the means to educate the public on <strong><u>wildlife etiquette is limited to park signages and lacks visibility in neighbourhoods</u></strong>.
Promoting wildlife etiquette encourage positive human-wildlife interactions
before conflict occurs.</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p><strong><u>EcoEncounters simulates wildlife encounters for individuals to learn wildlife etiquette through fun bite-sized chats on Telegram</u>. </strong>Learn
the appropriate actions and behaviours around animals!
<br>
<br>Participants are encouraged to continue their learning through badges
they earn through daily interactions with the game. These badges can be
easily shared to social media and can attract curious friends who want
to take part too. Although our MVP focuses on the topic on Macaques, the
game can be scaled to other wildlife topics in future.
<br>
<br>EcoEncounters is first targeted to nature-loving zillenial parents as:
<br>1) They raising the next generation of children living in the City in
Nature.
<br>2) They are early adopters of new activities to entertain their children
and are eager promoters of positive experiences in their respective social
media, nature and parental groups.</p>

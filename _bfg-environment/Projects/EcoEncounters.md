<p>Hi! We're Team Kreta and we're grateful to be part of this hackathon.
We're ready to learn and stretch our creative muscles as we develop a product
people love! See you around :)</p>
<p><strong>Team members: </strong>Nysha Tan (Design/Product), Kianne Lim
(Design/Product), Lin Zhenming (Product/Software Engineer), Srushti Ganesh
(Product/Data Analytics)</p>
<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>As we conserve green spaces to become a City in Nature, our well-being
and health are inter-connected with wildlife. Yet, what we lack is the
mindset to coexist with wildlife.
<br>
<br>Family time provides the opportunity to encourage positive human-wildlife
interactions as parents seek out activities that fosters their children's
character growth and their view of nature.
<br>
<br>How might games shape a childâ€™s perspective of caring for the natural
environment we live in?</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p>Design for a wildlife educational game to promote positive human-wildlife
interactions.</p>

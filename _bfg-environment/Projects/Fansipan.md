<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>A study conducted by USA's department of Energy estimates that up to 10%
of a household's electricity consumption and a separate study conducted
by NRDC estimates this amount can reach up to 23%. This is similarly a
problem in Singapore where according to national grid power operator SP
Group, standby power accounts for up to 10 per cent of total household
energy usage.
<br>
<br>This is commonly due to devices being left plugged into sockets, causing
them to draw current even while not in use. This will result in electricitty
wastage and when left unchecked, will result in higher energy costs for
households, as well as an increased average load on the power grid. Resolving
this issue will lower energy consumption across the board and lead to cost
savings for households, a lower power grid load and less carbon emissions
generated to produce electricity</p>

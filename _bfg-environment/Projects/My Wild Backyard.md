<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>In 2021, at least 200,000 e-commerce parcels were shipped daily in Singapore.
Packaging waste contributes to 1/3 of the household waste and 2-3% of this
is from e-commerce. Reusing packaging currently poses logistical challenges
like returning and sorting. How might we reduce the amount of packaging
waste that is being generated by e-commerce, by helping consumers and local
companies reuse packaging for e-commerce?</p>

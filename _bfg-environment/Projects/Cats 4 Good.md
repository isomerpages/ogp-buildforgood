<p>We are Cats 4 Good, a group of NUS students passionate about building
technology for social good! Our mission is to unite community and businesses
in our collective fight against food waste while educating everyone along
the way. Follow us on this exciting journey and be a part of our bid to
make a difference!</p>

<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>In 2022, food waste accounted for 11% of total waste generated in Singapore
at 813,000 tonnes, with a recycling rate of only 18%. In particular, bakeries
discard unsold baked goods at the end of each working day due to overproduction
and the perishable nature of baked goods.</p>
<p>Disposal is the most convenient and cost-effective option, resulting in
significant food waste despite the goods still being consumable. Food from
the Heart, a local food bank committed to battling hunger, collects 28,000
kg of bread waste as part of its Bread Run programme alone. Demand for
such baked goods should be scaled accordingly in real time to sell goods
that need to be urgently cleared.</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>Our community-aided solution addresses the issue of food waste and helps
customers save by connecting them with local bakeries and food outlets
with excess stock. Both customers and bakeries can create an account to
post announcements of excess stock and / or special discounts directly
on the platform. These posts are tagged to specific locations and can be
viewed by users on a smart interactive map. Irrelevant or duplicate listings
are filtered away by a lightweight AI validation, allowing users to easily
find great deals close to them. Users can also share posts with others
via other social media platforms easily, increasing the reach of our solution
beyond current users. By allowing posts from customers, the app creates
a collaborative environment where everyone can share new deals and work
towards reducing food waste as a community.
<br>
<br>To further engage our users, our stretch goals will include incorporating
gamification elements into our solution. Users can earn points and badges
for various activities like posting deals or engaging with the community.
Such recognition provides credibility for users who post frequently, and
serve as an extra layer of motivation for them to interact with the platform,
similar to badges on Tripadvisor.</p>

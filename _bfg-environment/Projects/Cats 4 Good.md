<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>In 2022, food waste accounted for 11% of total waste generated in Singapore
at 813,000 tonnes, with a recycling rate of only 18%. In particular, bakeries
discard unsold baked goods at the end of each working day due to overproduction
and the perishable nature of baked goods.</p>
<p>Disposal is the most convenient and cost-effective option, resulting in
significant food waste despite the goods still being consumable. Food from
the Heart, a local food bank committed to battling hunger, collects 28,000
kg of bread waste as part of its Bread Run programme alone. Demand for
such baked goods should be scaled accordingly in real time to sell goods
that need to be urgently cleared.</p>

<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>In 2021, at least 200,000 e-commerce parcels were shipped daily in Singapore.
Packaging waste contributes to 1/3 of the household waste and 2-3% of this
is from e-commerce. Reusing packaging currently poses logistical challenges
like returning and sorting. How might we reduce the amount of packaging
waste that is being generated by e-commerce, by helping consumers and local
companies reuse packaging for e-commerce?</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p>Eco-warriors in the community already collect significant quantities of
e-commerce packages from themselves and their friends and families for
drop-off at collection points. Our solution enhances their impact by connecting
them with eco-friendly individuals who have packages to donate but find
it inconvenient. These eco-friendly individuals can prepare their packages
and arrange meet-ups or pick-ups with nearby eco-warriors. Eco-warriors
will then run quality checks, sort the packages, and either deliver them
to small e-commerce businesses that reuse packaging for a nominal fee or
donate the surplus to central collection points.
<br>
<br>In summary, our app provides information on preparing packages for return,
connects eco-conscious individuals with nearby eco-warriors for collection,
and facilitates a marketplace for distributing packages to small businesses.</p>

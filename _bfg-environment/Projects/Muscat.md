<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>With the mission of becoming a City in Nature, there is an increase in
green spaces and nature corridors islandwide. While this enhances urban
biodiversity and brings nature closer to residents, it also attracts wildlife
into urban areas. This shift has led to an inevitable rise in human-wildlife
conflicts, primarily due to a lack of awareness about managing healthy
human-wildlife relationships. NParks thus receive minimally 10,000 emails
annually, however, due to limited manpower, responding to these queries
swiftly is difficult, resulting in user dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>How can we then encourage appropriate reactions and actions from people
when they encounter wildlife in their backyards by equipping them with
the knowledge and assistance they need in light of such situations?</p>

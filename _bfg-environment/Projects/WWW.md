<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Singapore ranked 21st out of 155 countries/territories in terms of CO2
emissions per capita in 2021. Power generation is one of the major sources
of Singaporeâ€™s carbon emissions, accounting for about 40% of total emissions.
Households contribute about 15% of this through electricity consumption.
<br>
<br>Since 2017, in bid to tackle an increasing average household energy consumption
trend, the Ministry of Sustainability and Environment (MSE) has launched
several public awareness campaigns, including:
<br>
<br>- The Switch and Save Programme in 2018 to encourage the adoption of LED
lights in smaller flats.
<br>- The Energy-Saving Challenges in 2017 and 2018, which promoted simple
electricity-saving tips across all households.
<br>- The Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme, in place since 2008, which covers
an increasing variety of appliances.
<br>- The Climate Friendly Household Programme since 2020 to help households
defray the costs of switching to more energy-efficient appliances.
<br>
<br>However, the long-term effectiveness of these initiatives remains to be
seen as average household electricity consumption is only now returning
to pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019. Moreover, a hotter Singapore due to
climate change poses an increasing challenge to energy-saving habits, such
as using fans instead of air conditioning.
<br>It is also unclear whether people fully understand energy labels as the
numerous factors involved in choosing long-lasting, energy-efficient appliances
can be overwhelming.
<br>
<br>Choosing the right energy-efficient appliances is crucial, as it will
lock in energy consumption demand for years, if not decades. Therefore,
we aim to help homeowners improve their household energy efficiency by
making it easy to make an informed decisions when deciding what to buy.</p>

<h4>Meet the team</h4>

<p><strong>Team members: </strong>Aden (Software Engineer), Grace (Software
Engineer), Ethan (Data/ ML/ AI), Kyra (Product Manager)</p>
<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Singaporeans who are compost makers and food scrap givers are facing significant
challenges in finding and connecting with each other. Currently, there
is no efficient platform or system in place to facilitate these connections,
resulting in missed opportunities for sustainable waste management and
compost production.</p>
<p>This lack of connectivity hinders both groups' efforts to effectively
source and donate food scraps, ultimately affecting their ability to contribute
to environmental sustainability. Connecting these stakeholders would encourage
an increase in composting efforts and increase the utilisation of these
food scraps</p>

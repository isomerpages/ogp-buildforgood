<h4>Meet the team</h4>

Manager)</p>
<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Numerous initiatives aimed at improving public toilet cleanliness were
implemented as early as 1983. However, a 2023 SMU study (with over 9,400
Singaporeans interviewed) revealed that two-thirds of Singaporeans perceive
local hawker centre and coffee shop toilets to be as dirty or even dirtier
than in 2020.
<br>
<br>Currently, Clean Dream Crew (CDC) spoke with stakeholders in the scene
and found that there is a lack of communication and knowledge on the baseline
standards of how 'clean' a toilet should be.&nbsp;Moreover, stakeholders
are also unclear on the exact nature of the challenges in toilet cleanliness,
and are ill-equipped to develop targeted solutions.
<br>
<br>For example, ABC* coffeeshop remains unclear on the exact standards of
toilet cleanliness mandated by Singapore Food Agency (SFA) - the main agency
governing public toilets in coffeeshops. ABC continues to rely on the ad-hoc
recommendations by SFA when issues were identified, which do not always
help improve cleaning operations. In one instance, rubber mats requested
by SFA made toilet cleaning even more arduous.
<br>
<br>ABC* is renamed for their privacy.</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p>To support this, the Clean Dream Crew (CDC) will develop a Data Ecosystem
that identifies key baseline aspects of coffeeshop toilet cleanliness,
and support stakeholders such as coffeeshop owners, cleaners, toilet goers,
Public Hygiene Council, and other institutions to capture the key data
that will help them tackle the issue.
<br>
<br>For the space of the hackathon, CDC will focus on developing an accessible,
in-person data collection mechanism that crowdsources toilet goers' feedback
on whether the toilets are clean. This live data will in turn will be translated
into actionable insights on a dashboard that will (1) notify cleaners on
when toilets urgently need to be clean; (2) track what toilet goers consider
to be minimally clean; and (3) inform toilet goers on the issues their
toilets face and how they can help.</p>

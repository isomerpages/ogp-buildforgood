<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Numerous initiatives in public toilet hygiene were implemented dating
as early back in 1983 aimed at improving public toilet cleanliness in Singapore.
However, there is still significant challenge highlighted by the findings
of a 2023 study conducted by SMU, with over 9,400 Singaporeans interviewed.
The study revealed that two-thirds of Singaporeans perceive local hawker
centre and coffee shop toilets to be as dirty or even dirtier than in 2020.
<br>
<br>This stagnation in cleanliness levels can be attributed to a prevailing
belief among toilet-goers that the responsibility for maintaining toilet
cleanliness primarily lies with coffeeshop management rather than being
perceived as a collective effort.
<br>
<br>Specifically, 66.74% of respondents indicated that cleanliness levels
had remained stagnant or deteriorated, while only 22.18% believed in any
improvement.
<br>
<br>This perception has fostered a sense of complacency and a lack of accountability
among both patrons and proprietors, hindering significant progress in enhancing
toilet hygiene standards over the past decade. Without a shift in this
mindset towards recognizing and embracing the shared responsibility for
toilet cleanliness, efforts to address the issue are likely to continue
facing significant challenges, adversely affecting public health and overall
sanitation standards in Singapore.</p>

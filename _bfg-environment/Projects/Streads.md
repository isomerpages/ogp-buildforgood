<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Online shoppers in Singapore are aware of sustainability issues but only
10% consider environmental impacts when buying fast fashion clothes.
<br>
<br>Many users are unaware of alternatives to fast fashion or struggle to
prioritize reducing their environmental impacts, finding it difficult to
look beyond the immediate gratification of low prices, convenience, and
trendiness.
<br>
<br>Propelled by the popularity of fast fashion, production rates of low-quality
textiles have doubled; while lifetime usage of clothing has decreased by
36% since the 2000s. This has led to massive environmental impacts such
as higher carbon emissions, water pollution, and increased waste - all
of which are intensifying.
<br>
<br>We aim to create an online shopping environment where environmental impacts
and shopping alternatives are considered equally alongside the immediate
gratifications of fast fashion, encouraging consumers to make more responsible
choices rather than defaulting to fast fashion.</p>

<p>We are LeftUnder, a team from a multitude of disciplines, getting together
to tackle the prevailing food waste issue in our community. We aim to create
a better relationship between how we as consumers view food waste, our
consumption habits and our how awareness can impact our community as a
whole.
<br>
<br>We hope to introduce a all-in-one, low friction way to contribute to a
lesser food waste nation. Our solution helps anyone achieve the core principles
in conscious food buying, by refusing excess, reducing waste, and reusing
food within the household or through the larger community around us.
<br>
<br>Like many before us, we understand that this issue has been tackled before
and we want to contribute to the ongoing conversation as well. Watch this
space!</p>

<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Households with 3 people or less who cook purchase ingredients in portions
that are more than they need for their meals weekly, since pre-packaged
items in supermarkets have a fixed quantity. These ingredients include
fresh produce (vegetables &amp; fruits), meat and poultry, dairy products
and sauces.</p>
<p>
<br>This leads to them only utilizing about 50% of the amount and leaving
the rest in the fridge, which ends up getting spoiled/expired because they
do not know what to do with it or forgot about it.</p>
<p>
<br>This then leads to food waste being generated and hence contributes to
the landfill issue in Singapore since food waste are usually incinerated
and disposed of in the landfills, and up to 20% of the total waste generated
in Singapore in 2022 was from food waste alone, out of which 10% were contributed
by households.</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p><strong>Context and Solution (Telegram):<br></strong>When interviewing
our users, we realised that the way users track their food is either by
keying it in some notes app that they already have, or use a personal chat
to add those items in. With that insight, in order to reduce the inertia
of getting a user to download a new app or sign up just to complete their
tracking tasks, we decided to go with utilizing Telegram's bots and mini-apps
function to fit our case.
<br>
<br><strong>Features:<br></strong>1. Automated input of ingredients users
want to track
<br>2. Automated updating of ingredients in the pantry depending on what has
been used
<br>3. Reminders
<br>4. Recommendations

<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Households with 3 people or less who cook purchase ingredients in portions
that are more than they need for their meals weekly, since pre-packaged
items in supermarkets have a fixed quantity. These ingredients include
fresh produce (vegetables &amp; fruits), meat and poultry, dairy products
and sauces.</p>
<p>
<br>This leads to them only utilizing about 50% of the amount and leaving
the rest in the fridge, which ends up getting spoiled/expired because they
do not know what to do with it or forgot about it.</p>
<p>
<br>This then leads to food waste being generated and hence contributes to
the landfill issue in Singapore since food waste are usually incinerated
and disposed of in the landfills, and up to 20% of the total waste generated
in Singapore in 2022 was from food waste alone, out of which 10% were contributed
by households.</p>

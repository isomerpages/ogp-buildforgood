<p>We are LeftUnder, a team from a multitude of disciplines, getting together
to tackle the prevailing food waste issue in our community. We aim to create
a better relationship between how we as consumers view food waste, our
consumption habits and our how awareness can impact our community as a
whole.
<br>
<br>We hope to introduce a all-in-one, low friction way to contribute to a
lesser food waste nation. Our solution helps anyone achieve the core principles
in conscious food buying, by refusing excess, reducing waste, and reusing
food within the household or through the larger community around us.
<br>
<br>Like many before us, we understand that this issue has been tackled before
and we want to contribute to the ongoing conversation as well. Watch this
space!</p>

<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Households with 3 people or less who cook purchase ingredients in portions
that are more than they need for their meals weekly, since pre-packaged
items in supermarkets have a fixed quantity. These ingredients include
fresh produce (vegetables &amp; fruits), meat and poultry, dairy products
and sauces.</p>
<p>
<br>This leads to them only utilizing about 50% of the amount and leaving
the rest in the fridge, which ends up getting spoiled/expired because they
do not know what to do with it or forgot about it.</p>
<p>
<br>This then leads to food waste being generated and hence contributes to
the landfill issue in Singapore since food waste are usually incinerated
and disposed of in the landfills, and up to 20% of the total waste generated
in Singapore in 2022 was from food waste alone, out of which 10% were contributed
by households.</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p>Leftunder is an easy-access, hassle-free, and AI-powered food tracking
&amp; recommendation solution that aims to solve the problem of food waste
in Singapore by tackling the inconveniences that users are facing when
tracking food items. We found out that users do have the intention to track
their food so it does not go to waste, but due to current solutions being
very manual and requiring them to download another app, they have never
committed to any. Thus, we came up with the idea to host our solution via
a Telegram bot (to remove the need to download another app or create another
account plus having high visibility since Telegram is mostly used daily),
power it with AI to remove the manual aspects of inputting the various
food items for tracking &amp; giving customized recommendations on what
to do with leftover ingredients, and connecting it with a clean, intuitive
user interface where users can be on top of what they have, any time, anywhere.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Features:<br></strong>1. Automated input of ingredients users
want to track
<br>2. Automated updating of ingredients in the pantry depending on what has
been used
<br>3. Reminders
<br>4. Recommendations</p>

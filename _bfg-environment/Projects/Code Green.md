<p>Hi! We are Code Green, a team with diverse backgrounds in design, engineering,
finance and law. Like our name, we hope to design and code solutions for
a greener Singapore. What we're tackling is household food waste, and we
want to help Singaporeans better manage their groceries to reduce avoidable
food waste.</p>
<p><strong>Team members: </strong>Edward (Backend, ML), Eugene (Backend,
AI), Ke Er (Frontend, UI/UX), Zhiyi (Backend, AI), Zhuo Hui (UI/UX)</p>
<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>In Singapore, households contribute significantly to food waste, discarding
approximately 26,000 tonnes of food annually, valued at $342 million. This
largely avoidable issue is primarily driven by overbuying and a lack of
planning with purchases made at supermarkets and wet markets.
<br>
<br>The problem is particularly prevalent in households with multiple members
who purchase and cook groceries once a week or more. These households often
lack effective means to track and manage their food inventory, leading
to unnecessary purchases and significant waste. Poor planning in grocery
shopping and meal preparation exacerbates the issue, resulting in impulse
buys and the accumulation of uneaten cooked and uncooked food.
<br>
<br>Food waste mostly gets incinerated and thrown into Semakau landfill, contributing
to it filling up by 2035. We need a way to help Singaporeans play their
individual part in responsible food consumption, and collectively delay
that D-day for a little longer.</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p>We are designing a smart grocery tracking app to help users keep track
of what they have in the fridge and when it expires. The app sends expiry
reminders and help users to clear their inventory by generating recipes
based on the ingredients that they have. We plan to encourage stickiness
by adding gamification features like an activity streak, and adding friends
to compare food waste.
<br>
<br>Can we get Singaporeans to be more kiasu about reducing food waste? :D</p>

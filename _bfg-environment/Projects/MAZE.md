<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>The healthcare sector contributes a total of 4.4% of global carbon emissions
(2019), with 70% stemming from medical waste. In Singapore, over-prescription
is a major issue, with over a third of elderly patients taking unnecessary
medication in 2016.
<br>
<br>Current drug disposal methods are unsustainable and prevent unused medications
from being distributed to those who need them. A safe and efficient system
for medication exchange is crucial to address this issue, reducing waste,
mitigating environmental impact, and improving healthcare accessibility.</p>

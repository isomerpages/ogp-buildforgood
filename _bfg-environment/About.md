<p>Last year, we invited you to share with us the top issues in Singapore,
and environmental issues emerged as one of the top three! So this year,
we are back with another round of Build for Good, in partnership with the
Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment's <a href="https://www.mse.gov.sg/sgecofund/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SG Eco Fund</a>, with a focus
on the environment.</p>
<p>Join us in building solutions to address environmental issues that matter
to you, be it food waste, recycling, public hygiene, and more.</p>
<h3><strong>Event Timeline</strong></h3>
<p>The hackathon will run from 18 May to 22 June 2024, which consists of
a kickoff, 4 weekly sessions, and a finale event. In between these sessions,
Builders are free to continue working on their projects in their own time.
We will provide working spaces on Thursdays to allow teams to work on their
projects.</p>
<p>Do note that all sessions are on Saturdays and held in-person only so
as to maximise the Builders’ experience.</p>

<p>Last year, we asked you to share with us what are the top problems in
Singapore, and environmental problems emerged as one of the top three!
This year, we are back with another round of Build for Good, partnering
with the <a href="https://www.mse.gov.sg/sgecofund/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment's SG Eco Fund</u></a> to
zoom in on the environment!
<br>
<br>Join us to build solutions that tackle environmental issues that you’re
passionate about, be it food waste, recycling, public hygiene, and more.</p>
<h3><strong>Event Timeline</strong></h3>
<p>The hackathon will run from 18 May to 22 June 2024, which consists of
a kickoff, 4 weekly sessions, and a finale event. In between these sessions,
Builders are free to continue working on their projects in their own time.
We will provide working spaces on Thursdays to allow teams to work on their
projects.</p>
<p>Do note that all sessions are on Saturdays and held in-person only so
as to maximise the Builders’ experience.</p>

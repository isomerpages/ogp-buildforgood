<h2><strong>Accelerator and Funding</strong></h2>
<p>This year, winning teams of the Build for Good 2024 hackathon have the
opportunity to be empowered further to advance their solutions for public
good with a 2-month accelerator programme and funding of up to S$84,000.&nbsp;To
unlock the opportunity, winning teams will be required to enter into separate
agreements that are prescribed by GovTech and SG Eco Fund at the appropriate
juncture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please also refer to Clause 15 of the Build for Good Participation Terms
and Conditions found <a href="https://www.build.gov.sg/terms-of-use/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Accelerator</strong></h3>
<p>The accelerator programme will focus on imparting skills, knowledge and
networks essential for scaling solutions through sustained growth, and
launch them with real users.
<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Duration: 29 June 2024 - 17 Aug 2024 (1-2 days a week)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who can participate: It is currently only open to winning teams, who may
join the programme after the hackathon, subject to the winning team entering
into 2 separate agreements (one prescribed by OGP and the other by SG Eco
Fund).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weekly sessions will be conducted in person</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Funding</strong></h3>
<p>OGP and SG Eco Fund will, at their discretion and subject to terms and
conditions of separate agreements entered into by the winning team with
GovTech and with SG Eco Fund, provide funding of up to $84,000* to support
teams through various phases from product development and user acquisition
during the accelerator programme, to scaling and sustained growth thereafter.

<p>The 1st phase of funding, to be covered under an agreement between GovTech
and the winning team, supports the following key milestones during the
accelerator programme:
<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Refining minimum viable product (MVP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Securing a key partnership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running a pilot; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scaling and acquisition</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon achieving these milestones, S$1,000 will be given to each winning
team member as a token of appreciation for public good contributions. This
S$1,000 will be part of the maximum of S$20,000 in funding that may be
made available under Phase 1.</p>

<p>The 2nd phase supports further scaling and growth of the solution, and
it covers the following (to be set out in an agreement between SG Eco Fund
and the winning team):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Professional services (e.g. events management, workshop, facilitation,
behavioral study, audit);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event venue rental;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educational materials (e.g. brochures, publications, books);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marketing and publicity (e.g. production of posters, EDMs, photography);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logistics and transportation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equipment and tools necessary for project implementation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>*Under such agreement, SG Eco Fund will fund up to S$64,000 (the exact
quantum will be determined by SG Eco Fund at the appropriate juncture and
set out in such agreement) for supportable costs under Phase 2 provided
that the winning team co-funds (including by obtaining separate corporate
sponsorship) 20% of the total supportable costs (what items of costs would
be considered 'supportable costs' would be defined in such agreement).
SG Eco Fund will have the sole and absolute discretion to reject any winning
team's costs which it does not deem to be 'supportable cost' (as defined
in such agreement).
<br>
<br>For illustration purposes only, if a winning team's total supportable
costs under Phase 2 is S$20,000, SG Eco Fund will fund S$64,000 (i.e. 80%)
provided that the winning team co-funds S$16,000 (i.e. 20%). Adding on
the maximum amount of S$20,000 that might be funded under Phase 1, the
maximum total funds that a winning team might have (including the portion
that the team co-funds itself) for their project is $100,000.</p>

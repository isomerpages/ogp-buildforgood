<h3><strong>Who can be a Builder</strong></h3>
<p>Anyone 18 and above with a strong desire to make Singapore better is welcome
to sign up to be a builder. Applicants may join as a team or as individuals,
though during the hackathon, all Builders will be required to eventually
form teams of 3 to 5.</p>
<p>Here are the 4 core attributes which we use to assess the applications:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Commitment: Is the applicant able to commit for all weekly sessions, and
willing to continue working on the solution beyond the hackathon?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initiative: Has the applicant demonstrated that he/she has thought through
the problem space, and even proposed possible solutions to the problem?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Values: Are there any past projects / involvement that demonstrates individual's
commitment to the public good?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abilities: What's the level of technical expertise the participant has
in his/her own field?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>What kind of solutions can I come up with?</strong></h3>
<p>Your solution should be a digital/physical product or service that addresses
an <a href="/environment" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">environmental problem</a> in Singapore, and it should not be for the purpose
of generating profit.</p>
<p>You will be required to demonstrate a prototype that's backed by user
testing at the finale.</p>

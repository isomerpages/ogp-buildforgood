<p>Last year, we invited members of the public to identify important problems
to tackle in Singapore. Environment &amp; sustainability issues emerged
as one of the top 3 important areas of concern. With that, this year, we
are back with another round of Build for Good with a focus on the environment.
This is in partnership with the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment's
<a href="https://www.mse.gov.sg/sgecofund/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SG Eco Fund</a>.</p>
<p>Join us in building solutions to address environmental issues that matter
to you, be it food waste, recycling, public hygiene, and more.</p>
<h3><strong>Programme Timeline</strong></h3>
<p>Build for Good will consist of 2 phases - hackathon and accelerator. The
hackathon will run from 18 May to 22 June 2024, comprising of a kickoff,
4 weekly sessions, and a finale event. In between these sessions, builders
are free to continue working on their projects in their own time. We will
provide working spaces on Thursdays to allow teams to work on their projects.</p>
<p>Do note that all sessions are on Saturdays and held in-person only so
as to maximise the builders’ experience.</p>

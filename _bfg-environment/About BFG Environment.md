<p>After our environmental edition in June, we are back with another round
of Build for Good, this time addressing any public good problems!</p>
<p>Join us in building solutions to address issues that matter to you, be
it healthcare, elderly support, education, and more.</p>
<h3><strong>Programme Timeline</strong></h3>
<p>Build for Good will consist of two phases - hackathon and accelerator.
The hackathon will run from 28 Aug to 28 Sep 2024, comprising a kickoff
session, four weekly sessions, and a finale. In between these sessions,
builders are free to continue working on their projects in their own time.</p>
<p>Do note that all sessions are compulsory and held in-person only so as
to maximise the builders’ experience.</p>

we crowdsourced from citizens last year. Builders may still work on problems
that are not mentioned above, as long as they are public good problems.</p>

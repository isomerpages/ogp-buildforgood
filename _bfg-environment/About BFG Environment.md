<p>Last year, we invited citizens to identify important public good problems
and build solutions to tackle them. Environment and sustainability issues
emerged as one of the top three important areas of concern. With that,
we are back this year with another round of Build for Good, focusing on
the environment. This is in partnership with <a href="https://www.mse.gov.sg/sgecofund/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SG Eco Fund</a>, which is administered
by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment.</p>
<p>Join us in building solutions to address environmental issues that matter
to you, be it food waste, recycling, public hygiene, and more.</p>
<h3><strong>Programme Timeline</strong></h3>
<p>Build for Good will consist of two phases - hackathon and accelerator.
The hackathon will run from 18 May to 22 June 2024, comprising a kickoff
session, four weekly sessions, and a finale event. In between these sessions,
builders are free to continue working on their projects in their own time.
We will provide working spaces on Thursday evenings to allow teams to work
on their projects.</p>
<p>Do note that all sessions are on Saturdays and held in-person only so
as to maximise the builders’ experience.</p>

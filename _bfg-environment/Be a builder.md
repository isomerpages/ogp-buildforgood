### **Why you should be a builder**
* **Build solutions that tackle real environmental problems** 

* **Deepen your understanding of the environmental sector** 

* **Receive mentorship from tech & environmental experts** 

*  **Present your solutions to government leaders and industry experts** 

### **Who can be a builder?**
Anyone 18 and above with a strong desire to make Singapore better is welcome to sign up to be a builder. Interested builders may join as a team or as individuals, though during the hackathon, all builders will be required to eventually form teams of 2 to 5. You may indicate in the signup form if you want to find your own teammates or if you would like us to match you with potential teammates instead.

Tech expertise is preferred but not necessary to join as a builder. We do recommend however that your hackathon team consists of members with the skills required to build the solution you want to make. We will be hosting networking sessions as well as engineering, design, and product workshops to help you along the way!

### **What kind of solutions can I come up with?**

Your solution should be a digital/physical product or service that addresses an environmental problem in Singapore, and it should not be for the purpose of generating profit. 

You will be required to demonstrate a prototype that's backed by user testing at the finale.

If you need inspiration, you can check out the projects from our last Build for Good!

### **Event Timeline**

The hackathon will run from 18 May to 22 June 2024, which consists of a kickoff, 4 weekly sessions, and a finale event. In between these sessions, builders are free to continue working on their projects in their own time.

Do note that all sessions are on Saturdays and held in-person only so as to maximise the builders’ experience.

*  **Weekly session 1:** 25 May
*  **Weekly session 2:** 1 June
*  **Weekly session 3:** 8 June

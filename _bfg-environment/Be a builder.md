<p>We are back with another round of Build for Good, but this time, we are
partnering with the <a href="https://www.mse.gov.sg/sgecofund/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment's SG Eco Fund</a> to
zoom in on the environment!
<br>
<br>Join us to build solutions that tackle environmental issues that you’re
passionate about, be it food waste, sustainability, climate change, and
more.</p>
<h3><strong>Why you should be a builder</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Build solutions that tackle real environmental problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deepen your understanding of the environmental sector</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receive mentorship from tech &amp; environmental experts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Present your solutions to government leaders and industry experts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Winning teams will receive funding of up to S$100,000* and take part in
a 2-month accelerator program to further develop their solutions, and potentially
launch them to real users!

<h3><strong>Who can be a builder?</strong></h3>
<p>Anyone 18 and above with a strong desire to make Singapore better is welcome
to sign up to be a builder. Interested builders may join as a team or as
individuals, though during the hackathon, all builders will be required
to eventually form teams of 2 to 5. You may indicate in the signup form
if you want to find your own teammates or if you would like us to match
you with potential teammates instead.</p>
<p>Tech expertise is preferred but not necessary to join as a builder. We
do recommend however that your hackathon team consists of members with
the skills required to build the solution you want to make. We will be
hosting engineering, design, and product workshops to help you along the
way!</p>
<h3><strong>What kind of solutions can I come up with?</strong></h3>
<p>Your solution should be a digital/physical product or service that addresses
an environmental problem in Singapore, and it should not be for the purpose
of generating profit.</p>
<p>You will be required to demonstrate a prototype that's backed by user
testing at the finale.</p>
<p>If you need inspiration, you can check out the projects from our last
Build for Good!</p>
<h3><strong>Event Timeline</strong></h3>
<p>The hackathon will run from 18 May to 22 June 2024, which consists of
a kickoff, 4 weekly sessions, and a finale event. In between these sessions,
builders are free to continue working on their projects in their own time.
We will provide working spaces on Thursdays to allow teams to work on their
projects.</p>
<p>Do note that all sessions are on Saturdays and held in-person only so
as to maximise the builders’ experience.</p>

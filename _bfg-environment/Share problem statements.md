### **What are some pressing environmental problems in Singapore? Share them with us!**

Whether you're an individual or representing a non-profit, tell us more about the environmental problems that you believe Singapore is facing. By sharing these problem statements, our builders will have the opportunity to tackle some of these problems during Build for Good and work towards a greener Singapore. These submissions will also help us better understand what problems citizens care most about.

### Key areas in the environmental space

* Climate change
* Energy
* Environmental Pollution
* Food security
* Nature & biodiversity
* Recycling
* Waste

**We will be opening problem statement submissions on 13 March 2024**

Should our builders express interest in your problem statement submission, we will contact you to find out more and collaborate on the issue you've raised.

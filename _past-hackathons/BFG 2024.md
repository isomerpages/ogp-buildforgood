<p>From Aug to Sep 2024, we ran our third and largest run of the Build for
Good hackathon, in collaboration with the Singapore Government Partnerships
Office (SGPO) to foster deeper citizen-government co-creation. Over the
month, 100 builders - including students, tech professionals and public
officers, came up with 21 innovative solutions tackling diverse problems
such as eldercare, healthcare, sustainability, and inclusivity.</p>
<p>Five teams moved on to an 8-week accelerator program to further develop
and launch their products, with S$20,000 funding support:</p>

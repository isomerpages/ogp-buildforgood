<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Of the 800,000 tons of food waste generated annually in Singapore, an
increasing share is flowing through online channels, as $0.7B worth of
food &amp; groceries was purchased online in 2023 with a ~20% CAGR. E-commerce
grocery merchants face a problem with food waste from expiring food on
their online stores; we are aiming to tackle this problem with LastcallSG.</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>LastCall SG is a marketplace that aggregates expiring food from online
grocery retailers.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Online grocery merchants can list expiring food items on LastCall SG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community members can discover and reserve expiring food items for free
or at a heavily discounted price.
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that discounts can be an effective way to encourage consumers
to adopt more sustainable behaviors and promote sustainability actions.</p>

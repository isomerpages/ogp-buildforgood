<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Compost makers and food scrap givers in Singapore are facing significant
challenges in finding and connecting with each other. The lack of an efficient
and community-oriented platform or system leads people to stick to subpar
methods of sourcing and donating food scraps. This results in missed connections
and consequently, missed opportunities for sustainable waste management
and compost production. Creating a more inclusive and collaborative platform
would enhance connections among these stakeholders, ultimately increasing
composting efforts, utilization of food scraps, and diverting food waste
from our landfills.</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p>Our solution focuses on establishing a reliable and efficient platform
to bridge this gap, which is essential for enhancing composting initiatives
and promoting a greener Singapore. By providing everything users need —
such as showing active users and listings to prevent wasted time on inactive
offers, forums to foster discussions and more — we create a strong sense
of community and easy way to connect. This communal effect and streamlined
process allows users to see and connect with the community around them,
encouraging them to stay engaged with our platform and increase composting
efforts due to the comprehensive, all inclusive platform</p>

<p>From May to June 2024, we ran our first thematic Build for Good hackathon,
partnering with <a href="https://www.mse.gov.sg/sgecofund/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SG Eco Fund</a> to
focus on environmental and sustainability issues. Over the month, our 80
builders came up with 19 innovative solutions, tackling diverse problems
ranging from waste to public hygiene.</p>
<p>Five teams were selected to receive up to S$100,000 funding each and have
completed an 8-week accelerator program to further develop and launch their
products:</p>
<h3>Koel</h3>
<p>Koel is an application that helps nature groups, academic researchers
and government employees process bioacoustic data more efficiently, which
improves the accuracy and efficiency of EIAs (Environmental Impact Assessments),
and helps reduce uninformed decision-making that may introduce a net harm
to our natural environment.</p>
<p>Through a pilot conducted with NParks covering 170 hectares at Bukit Timah
Nature Reserve, Koel has trained the model to recognise 10 bird species
and demonstrated a 20x decrease in time taken to analyse bird recording.</p>

<h3>CoastalClear</h3>
<p>CoastalClear is a predictive analytical and location booking tool that
provides better guidance to volunteers on where rubbish will land, what
areas need more frequent cleaning and what areas have been cleaned to ensure
volunteering resources are bring directed to the spaces that need it the
most.</p>
<p>Through pilots with organisations that organises beach cleanups, such
as Green Nudge and Stridy, Coastal Clear engaged 126 volunteers on the
platform and collected 328kg of coastal trash.</p>

<h3>ReportLah!</h3>
<p>ReportLah is a data ecosystem that collects feedback from coffeeshop toilet
users and translates them into actionable insights for key stakeholders
(e.g. coffeeshop owners, cleaners, Public Hygiene Council) to act on.</p>
<p>Through a pilot with Koufu at 2 coffeeshops and 1 food court, ReportLah!
collected 216 pieces of feedback from toilet users in 9 days, synthesising
key actionable insights for stakeholders to review.</p>

<h3>RemediSG</h3>
<p>RemediSG is an online platform that redistributes excess unused medication
to other healthcare providers with less priviledged recipients.</p>
<p>Through a pilot with Tan Tock Seng Hospital (donor) and HealthServe (recipient),
RemediSG successfully facilitated 5 donor-recipient matches, distributing
S$500 worth of medication which would otherwise have gone to waste, and
abated 10kg worth of CO2 emissions.</p>

<h3>SUSFeed</h3>
<p>SUSFeed is a fish feed formulated with upcycled food waste for food and
ornamental fish.</p>
<p>Through a pilot with Ho Li Ornamental Farm and Apollo Ornamental, SUSFeed
upcycled 20kg of food waste in total.</p>

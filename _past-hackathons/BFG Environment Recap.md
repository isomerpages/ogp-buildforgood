<p>From May to June 2024, we ran our first thematic Build for Good hackathon,
partnering with SG Eco Fund to focus on environmental and sustainability
issues. Over the month, our 80 builders came up with 19 innovative solutions,
tackling diverse problems ranging from waste to public hygiene.</p>
<p>We are excited to announce the five teams that were selected to receive
up to $100,000 funding each and go through an 8-week accelerator program
to further develop their products:</p>
<h3>Koel</h3>
<p>Koel is an application that helps nature groups, academic researchers
and government employees process bioacoustic data more efficiently, which
improves the accuracy and efficiency of EIAs (Environmental Impact Assessments),
and helps reduce uninformed decision-making that may introduce a net harm
to our natural environment.</p>

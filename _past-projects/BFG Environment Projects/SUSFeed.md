<p>We're a group of passionate Republic Polytechnic graduates with diverse
skills tackling sustainability at Build for Good! Our innovative startup
upcycles food waste into sustainable fish feed, aiming to reduce landfill
waste and promote a more eco-friendly food system.</p>
<p><strong>Team members: </strong>Javier Tan (Product), Azad Akim (Website/
Research), Yuen Sheng (Strategy)</p>
<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>In Singapore, generated approximately 817,000 tonnes of food waste (2023)
The recycling rate for food waste was 18%, 146,000 tonnes. The majority
of food waste in Singapore is incinerated at waste-to-energy (WTE) plants.
These plants burn the waste at high temperatures to reduce its volume by
up to 90% and generate electricity from the heat produced.</p>
<p>As of current estimates, the Semakau Landfill is projected to reach its
capacity by 2035 if waste disposal continues at the current rate. This
projection takes into account the daily addition of approximately 2,000
tonnes of incineration ash and non-incinerable waste (CNA) (Home - MSE).</p>
<p>Given that it is 2024, this implies that the landfill will be filled in
approximately 11 more years, assuming no significant changes in waste management
practices or reductions in waste generation occur during this period.</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p>Nutritious and affordable fish feed formulated using upcycled food waste
for both food and ornamental fish. This innovative feed would address the
dual challenges of affordability and fish health. About 63% percent of
food waste utilized in our ornamental fish formulation, while about 78%
of food waste utilized in our food fish formulation.</p>

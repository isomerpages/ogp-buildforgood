<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>In 2022, food waste accounted for 11% of total waste generated in Singapore
at 813,000 tonnes, with a recycling rate of only 18%. In particular, bakeries
discard unsold baked goods at the end of each working day due to overproduction
and the perishable nature of baked goods.</p>
<p>Disposal is the most convenient and cost-effective option, resulting in
significant food waste despite the goods still being consumable. Food from
the Heart, a local food bank committed to battling hunger, collects 28,000
kg of bread waste as part of its Bread Run programme alone. Demand for
such baked goods should be scaled accordingly in real time to sell goods
that need to be urgently cleared.</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>Crumbs is a community-based solution that addresses the food waste problem
by increasing reach and demand of clearance discounts, reducing wastage
of bakery products. Anyone can share when they find a “lobang”, which will
be tagged to its specific location and can be viewed by nearby users available
to take advantage. Via crowdsourcing information about discounts, Crumbs
creates a collaborative environment where everyone can share new deals
and work towards reducing food waste as a community.
<br>
<br>To further engage our users, our stretch goals will include incorporating
gamification elements into our solution. Users can earn points and badges
for various activities like posting deals or engaging with the community,
providing an extra layer of motivation for them to interact with the platform,
similar to badges on Tripadvisor. We also look to collaborate with bakeries
themselves to improve our reach and credibility, adding more robustness
to the social element of our platform while giving bakeries recognition
in the fight against food waste.</p>

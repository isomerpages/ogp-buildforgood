<br>Our team name, WWW, captures our varying levels of spirit over the course
of this rigorous hackathon: there's "We Will Win!", but also "We Won't
Win..." or "Will We Win?". Hopefully, "When We Win", "Why We Win" will
be because we were convincing in our solution for a real problem.
<br>
<br>Meet our team! We've got Bei Ying, who keeps things lively during those
tiring, long working calls calling Lewis every name under the sun—Robin,
Junxue, Joshua—you name it, she's tried it! Rest assured, Lewis takes it
in stride and responds to all of them.
<br>
<br>Jokes aside, we are a multidisciplinary team with a background in design,
engineering, and research. Our group aims to increase household energy
efficiency for a sustainable future - one home at a time.

<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Singapore ranked 21st out of 155 countries/territories in terms of CO2
emissions per capita in 2021. Power generation is one of the major sources
of Singapore’s carbon emissions, accounting for about 40% of total emissions.
Households contribute about 15% of this through electricity consumption.
<br>
<br>Since 2017, in bid to tackle an increasing average household energy consumption
trend since 2007, the Ministry of Sustainability and Environment (MSE)
has launched several public awareness campaigns, including:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Switch and Save Programme in 2018 to encourage the adoption of LED
lights in smaller flats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Energy-Saving Challenges in 2017 and 2018, which promoted simple electricity-saving
tips across all households.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme (MELS), in place since 2008, which
covers an increasing variety of appliances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Climate Friendly Household Programme since 2020 as well as the more
recent Climate Vouchers to help households defray the costs of switching
to more energy-efficient appliances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the long-term effectiveness of these initiatives remains to be
seen as average household electricity consumption is only now returning
to pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019. Moreover, a hotter Singapore due to
climate change poses an increasing challenge to energy-saving habits, such
as using fans instead of air conditioning. While NEA is making efforts
to help households become more energy efficient, people still find it hard
to grasp energy labels. The technical considerations needed to buy the
most suitable energy-efficient appliances based on personal needs can quickly
become overwhelming.
<br>
<br>Buying the right energy-efficient appliances is crucial and arguably a
more robust part of the equation in the context of households as it locks
in energy consumption demand for years, if not decades. People do not change
big-ticket electricity appliances like air-conditioners or refrigerators
readily. Therefore, we aim to help homeowners improve their household energy
efficiency by making it easy to understand what makes a holistic, informed
decision when it comes to buying electrical appliances.</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p>
<br><strong>Background</strong>
<br>To understand the challenges homeowners face in choosing energy-efficient
appliances, we conducted a survey and in-depth interviews with friends,
family, and colleagues. The primary painpoints identified were a difficulty
in making sense of complex technical information as well as making accurate
evaluations based on personal household needs. As air-conditioners make
up the largest share of household energy consumption (NEA Household Energy
Consumption Study, 2017), our MVP will focus on air-conditioners as a start.
<br>
<br><strong>Product summary<br></strong>To assist homeowners in selecting
the most cost-effective air-conditioners while being environmentally friendly,
we have built an Aircon Recommender based on key purchase considerations
shared by our target user group: striking an optimal balance between cost
effectiveness and wanting to do their part for sustainable living. The
website simplifies the decision-making process for users by honing down
to key factors, such as household size, usage frequency, installation location,
and budget. It also educates users about "energy efficiency" - what would
otherwise be a rather abstract concept - in a meaningful, personal way
during the selection process.

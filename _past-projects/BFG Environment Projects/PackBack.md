<p>Meet PolyNoMails, a team dedicated to saying NO to throwing away poly
mailers. Let's give them a second life by reusing! Coming from a diverse
background with skillsets from Product Management, Software Development,
and User Experience, we are ready to get you to join our fight against
e-commerce packaging waste!</p>
<p><strong>Team members: </strong>Anthony Hermanto (Software Engineer), Shelia
Teo (Software Engineer), Chua Jun Yu (Software Engineer), Tan Zi Xuan (Product
Manager / Software Engineer), Tanvi Thombre (UI/UX)</p>
<h4>Problem statement</h4>
<p>Every day, at least 200,000 e-commerce packages from various platforms
are delivered across Singapore, adding up to a staggering 17.7 million
tons of waste annually (WWF), 70% involving some form of plastic (KPMG).
E-commerce sales are projected to increase by 10% (Statista), reducing
the lifespan of our landfills.
<br>
<br>E-commerce buyers receive the packaging and take charge of their disposal.
Since many of them are unaware of existing reuse initiatives or are unwilling
to participate due to inconvenient drop-off locations, they either dispose
of or attempt to recycle them, unaware that common items such as poly mailers
and padded envelopes cannot be recycled. Meanwhile, small businesses continuously
require packaging materials to deliver their products.
<br>
<br>How might we reduce e-commerce packaging waste by creating a closed loop
that connects the demand for packaging materials (by small businesses)
and the supply of packaging materials (from e-commerce buyers)?</p>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
<p>PackBack is a mobile app designed to address e-commerce packaging waste
in Singapore by promoting the reuse of packaging through strategically
placed collection points known as PackBoxes. Targeted towards eco-minded
e-commerce buyers and eco-friendly small businesses, PackBack aims to create
a sustainable loop for packaging materials.</p>
<p>Eco-conscious buyers, who currently discard or recycle packaging, are
educated on the types of packaging that can be reused and the proper preparation
methods. They can locate nearby PackBoxes to drop off their packaging and
earn monetary incentives per package for correctly returning items, encouraging
continuous participation.</p>
<p>Eco-friendly small businesses, which need a constant supply of packaging,
can locate PackBoxes and filter by demand to purchase used packaging for
a nominal fee per package that is lower than market rates. This creates
a financially sustainable closed-loop of supply of and demand for e-commerge
packaging!</p>

### Problem Statement

Scammers are constantly creating new ways to make their scams look legit. Even young and digitally savvy people are susceptible: those aged 20-39 years old are the biggest victims. Scams cost us $661 million in 2022 and are terrible for Singapore economically and catastrophic for the victims.

### Proposed Solution

We are developing a “Scam-or-Not” game that tasks users with identifying scams from examples of scams and legit messages. Our goal is to make users better at detecting scams by providing data on harder-to-identify scams based on game results, allowing the authorities to concentrate resources on tackling them.

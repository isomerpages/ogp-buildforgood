### Problem Statement
In Singapore, reducing food waste is crucial to ensure food security and minimize environmental impact. 

Currently, about a quarter of household waste is avoidable food waste. It strains resources and also contributes to carbon emissions and climate change. 

To address this, we aim to help Singaporeans avoid over-buying groceries, thus reducing food waste and its detrimental effects on our society and the planet.

### Proposed Solution

A mobile application for Singaporeans to track grocery inventory within their households.

Members of a household can collaborate to make a grocery list while also keeping track of what has been bought and is available in their kitchens.

By increasing the visibility of the food items they already own, Singaporeans can make better purchasing decisions.

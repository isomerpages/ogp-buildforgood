<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Singapore faces a critical health challenge; while physical activity engagement
has increased to 78.5% in 2023, only one-third (33.7%) of the population
performs sufficient muscle-strengthening activities (<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/resources-statistics/reports/national-population-health-survey-2023-report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>National Population Health Survey 2023</u></a>).
This issue is particularly evident in adults over 30 and amongst females.
The lack of muscle-strengthening activities correlates strongly with increased
chronic disease risks, making this a significant public health concern.
<br>
</p>
<p>Common barriers include (1) gym anxiety, especially among beginners and
specific demographics (2) lack of proper guidance without costly personal
training (3) difficulty finding compatible workout partners. These factors
contribute to low participation rates despite the known health benefits
of strength training.
<br>
</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>OTOT is a community-led workout buddy finder that allows users to discover
nearby workout partners and create a safe and inclusive space for users
to exercise together. The platform leverages peer-to-peer community support,
where users motivate and learn from one another creating sustainable fitness
habits.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Core Features</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Buddy Finder Map Interface: </strong>Users are able to identify
nearby workout partners through a map interface and connect with compatible
workout partners based on proficiency level, schedule, and preferences.
Real-time availability tracking and in-app chat facilitate seamless coordination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Workout sessions: </strong>Users access pre-populated workout
suggestions based on the meetup location. This ensures proper progression
while allowing users to be flexible in their workouts of choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inclusive Communities: </strong>The platform creates dedicated
safe spaces especially for demographics like females and seniors who typically
face gym anxiety.&nbsp;

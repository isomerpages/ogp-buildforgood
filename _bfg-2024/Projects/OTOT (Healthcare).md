<p>Our team, "Legs Day," recognizes that strong legs are the cornerstone
of overall fitness and athletic performance. Just as how our Legs play
a critical role in any comprehensive fitness regimen, our team aims to
build a strong foundation for health and wellness through our innovative
fitness app.</p>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Singapore's healthcare sector faces increasing demands and costs with
limited resources. To address this challenge, we aim to engage in preventive
healthcare through promoting wellness. However, while Singapore’s physical
activity engagement has increased to 78.5% in 2023, only one-third (33.7%)
of the population performs sufficient muscle-strengthening activities (National
Population Health Survey 2023).
<br>
<br>Of these users, we discovered that working adults who intend to start
their muscle-strengthening training activities are hesitant to participate
as they are overwhelmed by the exercises or programs and have general misconceptions
towards the activities. As a result, this prevents individuals from participating
in any muscle strengthening activities, reducing their overall quality
of health.
<br>
</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>We plan to develop a simple fitness app solution targeted at working adults
looking to start their muscle strengthening journey. The app will feature
a simplified interface that recommends short and attainable workout programs
while also educating users on various misconceptions on muscle-strengthening
activities. Our solution aims to help users feel more assured and to familiarize
themselves with workouts, develop habits, and maintain consistency so they
will be inclined to progress and participate in the activities. Recommended
exercises and programs will utilise the Health Promotion Board (HPB) guidelines
as guidance.
<br><strong><br>Key features</strong>
<br>
<br><strong>Short-Form Curated Workouts:</strong>
<br>- Users will be greeted with a simplified user interface showcasing step-by-step
guidance on resistance training
<br>- These short-form exercises will educate users on proper techniques and
program structure in a digestible format.
<br>- This approach helps users familiarize themselves with activities, kickstarting
their muscle strengthening journey for a lifelong health.
<br>
<br><strong>Educational Library</strong>
<br>- Users will be greeted with a simple design and interface to make it
less intimidating for users to learn about resistance training
<br>- The Library will contain short Guides, videos and articles to address
common questions and misconceptions asked from starting resistance training.
<br>- The library acts as a resource for users to reference while performing
resistance training to check through their form and also understand how
resistance training can benefit their health
<br>
<br><strong>Streaks and Leaderboards</strong>
<br>- Completing a full path will fulfill a “streak”
<br>- Streaks will allow users to earn certain in-app badges
<br>- This can also be replaced with incentives if collaborations with HPB

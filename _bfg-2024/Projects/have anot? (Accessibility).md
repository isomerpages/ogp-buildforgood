<h4>Digital Inclusion &amp; Accessibility - Discoverability of Government Products</h4>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Government agencies often incur substantial costs when contracting vendors
to build large-scale technology systems. While this used to be inevitable,
the landscape has changed. Today, a wide range of competitive products
exists for nearly every use case, many of which are developed in-house
by agencies like GovTech or OGP. This presents an opportunity to reduce
costs by reusing existing solutions instead of reinventing the wheel. However,
many government officers responsible for system proposals are unfamiliar
with the range of available tools or lack the ability to think of a system
as combinations of modular components. As a result, they rely heavily on
vendor quotes, missing opportunities to fact-check costs or reuse existing
systems. Addressing this knowledge gap can significantly reduce both the
number of contracted components and overall expenses, while swinging the
bargaining power back in favour of the government agencies.</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>have anot? is an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to describe their
problem and discover government products that they can use to build a solution.
By understanding the user's pain points and solution requirements, the
chatbot recommends a suite of products that can solve the problem, along
with the solution architecture and estimated cost.</p>

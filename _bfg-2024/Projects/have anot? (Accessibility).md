<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Public officers seeking to digitize their processes often struggle with
defining their problems and lack awareness of existing government solutions
and how they can be combined to address specific challenges. This disconnect
leads to inefficient implementations that fail to tackle underlying issues,
resulting in lost opportunities for improved service delivery. Not to mention,
higher costs and longer development time. By fostering better problem scoping
and awareness of available resources, government agencies can achieve more
effective and sustainable digital transformations.</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>have anot? is an AI-powered chatbot that assists users in effectively
scoping their problems, suggesting features, and recommending existing
products for digital solutions. By streamlining the entire process, have
anot? enables public officers to minimize the need for completely bespoke
systems. This approach helps them save both costs and time, ultimately
enhancing their ability to serve citizens more effectively and efficiently.</p>

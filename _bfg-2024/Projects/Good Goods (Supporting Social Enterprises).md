<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Singaporeâ€™s social enterprise sector not only plays a pivotal role in
offering alternative employment opportunities to disadvantaged Singaporeans,
but also advocates for various important causes, including environmental
sustainability. While a 2020 Public Perception Study on Social Enterprises
in Singapore, commissioned by raiSE, revealed that awareness of social
enterprises has increased, ambivalence remains the leading barrier preventing
consumers from purchasing from these enterprises. This means that consumers
are willing to support social enterprises but will not go out of their
way to search for one that satisfies their needs.
<br>
<br>Our user survey corroborates these findings: 82.8% of respondents expressed
willingness to buy from F&amp;B and retail social enterprises, with 78.5%
highlighting convenience as a key motivator. However, among those aware
of social enterprises, 79.7% reported difficulty in locating businesses
that offer the specific products they seek.
<br>
<br>This situation points to a major hurdle for the social enterprise sector:
despite consumer willingness, there is a need to enhance the discovery
and accessibility of social enterprises.
<br>
</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>We are developing a web application called Good Goods, with the goal of
simplifying the process for buyers (those with interest to purchase) to
discover social enterprises that align with their needs while increasing
awareness of the diverse social enterprises in Singapore.
<br>
<br>For our minimum viable product (MVP), we plan to implement the following
key features:
<br>
<br><strong>1. Directory of Social Enterprises</strong>
<br>Buyers can filter social enterprises by product category, location, and
social causes. The enterprise background and stories will be available
for perusal.
<br>
<br><strong>2. AI-Powered Search Bar</strong>
<br>An intuitive search function where buyers can enter natural language queries
to find social enterprises that match their specific needs.
<br>
<br><strong>3. Crowdsourcing Feature</strong>
<br>An avenue for buyers to suggest social enterprises not yet listed on the
app.</p>

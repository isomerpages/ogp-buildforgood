<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Male retirees aged 50-60 are increasingly living alone and need to begin
active ageing activities early to prevent social isolation and its associated
health risks. This group is more vulnerable to isolation due to a lack
of existing social networks and community engagement opportunities as they
transition out of the workforce. As a result, their physical and mental
health deteriorates because they lack accessible, appealing opportunities
for social bonding, regular physical activity, and mental stimulation.</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>Our solution raises awareness and drives participation in skill-based
events specifically designed for male seniors. By linking upoffering activities
by organisations, such as AAC and PA that align with their interests —
such as gardening, cooking, and technology workshops — we create opportunities
for social engagement and purposeful involvement.
<br>
<br>How It Works:
<br>1. Personalised Event Discovery: A user-friendly platform that recommends
local events based on each senior's interests, making it easy to find and
join activities they enjoy.
<br>2. Buddy System: Seniors can connect with like-minded peers to attend
events together, fostering new friendships and reducing the fear of attending
alone.
<br>3. Community Ambassadors: Trained volunteers and active seniors help promote
events and welcome new participants, creating an inclusive, supportive
environment.
<br>
<br>
<br>Key Benefits:
<br>Meaningful Engagement: Provides seniors with purposeful activities that
encourage social interaction and skill development.
<br>Offline first, digital second: Starting point to foster in-person engagement
that facilitates new friendships and a sense of belonging.
<br>Wellbeing Integration: Incorporate features that track cognitive engagement
and social participation.
<br>
<br>By making local events accessible and inviting, our solution helps male
seniors find purpose, stay active, and enjoy a fulfilling social life.</p>

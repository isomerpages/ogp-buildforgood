<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Underpriviledged academically weaker students and volunteer tutors need
to bridge learning gaps by strengthening foundational knowledge and providing
continuous, tailored support aligned with the MOE syllabus during and between
tutoring sessions.
<br>
<br>This problem occurs when students struggle to understand class material
and retain information during self-study periods, and tutors face challenges
in identifying students‚Äô weaknesses and aligning their tutoring with the
curriculum due to limited time and students‚Äô reluctance to express difficulties.
<br>
<br>This results in students falling behind, lacking confidence, and being
unable to overcome challenging problems, and tutors spending excessive
time explaining concepts and motivating students without effectively addressing
specific needs, because students lack access to effective resources that
match their skill levels, and volunteer tutors are unfamiliar with the
MOE syllabus and have limited tools to identify and address students‚Äô weaknesses.</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>To address the challenges faced by underpriviledged academically weaker
students and volunteer tutors, we propose an integrated platform designed
to strengthen foundational knowledge and provide continuous, tailored support
aligned with the MOE syllabus.
<br>
<br><strong>Features</strong>
<br>- For Tutors: Customizable diagnostic tests, align tutoring with the MOE
syllabus, AI summarization of case notes, tutor-validated question bank
extracted from freetestpapers that are classified into topics/ sub-topics,
and a progress tracking dashboard.
<br>- For Students: Bite-sized micro-quizzes, ‚ÄúExplain Like I‚Äôm 5‚Äù (ELI5)
explanations of concepts, and personalized quiz recommendations.
<br>
<br><strong>Impact</strong>
<br>Improved academic performance, enhanced tutoring effectiveness, increased
engagement.</p>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Despite numerous government initiatives, Singapore has seen little progress
in improving dietary habits, which are crucial for preventing chronic diseases
like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity.</p>
<p>Clinical dieticians face difficulty in extracting accurate dietary meal
information from elderly patients. Many elderly patients communicate in
dialects that younger dieticians may not understand, leading to incomplete
or inaccurate nutritional assessments.</p>
<p>How can we develop more effective strategies to promote healthy eating
habits among Singaporeans and reduce the prevalence of these diet-related
chronic conditions?</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>Develop a tablet-based application designed for elderly patients to log
their meal history while waiting for their consultation in the hospital.
The app would use simple, intuitive interfaces, potentially incorporating
visual aids or voice input in various dialects. This allows elderly patients
to accurately communicate their dietary habits.
<br>
<br><strong>Impact: </strong>By the start of the consultation, dieticians
will have access to a comprehensive meal history. This streamlines the
dietary assessment process, enabling dieticians to focus on meal planning
tailored to the patientâ€™s dietary restrictions, ultimately improving the
quality of care and nutritional outcomes for elderly patients.

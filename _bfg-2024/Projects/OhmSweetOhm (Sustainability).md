<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Households often lack visibility into their energy use, leading to high
bills and inefficient consumption. There is a need for a solution that
provides actionable insights to help users reduce energy waste and lower
costs.</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
<br>Singapore’s reliance on imported fossil fuels and water, along with energy-intensive
processes like desalination and water reclamation, makes the nation vulnerable
to global market fluctuations and environmental challenges. As fossil fuels
deplete, sustainable management becomes more urgent, especially with increasing
urban needs and climate change.  Despite national conservation efforts
and rising citizen concern about the cost of living and household expenses,
many Singaporeans remain disengaged from energy-saving practices, leading
to higher environmental impact and household costs.
<br>
<br><strong>Proposed Solution</strong>
<br>We are developing a mobile-optimized web app that serves as a cost estimation
calculator. Users can input information about their electrical appliances,
such as wattage and usage frequency, to receive estimated energy consumption
and corresponding costs.
<br>
<br><strong>Benefits</strong>
<br>- Provides users with personalized cost estimates.
<br>- Encourages informed decision-making regarding appliance usage and provides
energy-saving tips.
<br>- Supports national sustainability goals by promoting energy efficiency.</p>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Ask anyone about their favourite dishes and Singaporeans will tell you
their go-to places for the best nasi lemak or sushi. We’re a nation of
foodies, but did you know that food waste continues to rank as one of the
largest waste streams in Singapore? Just last year, 755 million kg of food
waste was generated, accounting for 11% of all waste in the country.
<br>
<br>Social enterprises and food rescue missions have sprung up to divert as
much food as possible away from our landfills, and to the tummies of regular
folks like you and I instead, as well as to beneficiaries in need. In this
whole-of-society effort, food businesses who wish to donate surplus food
need to indicate the amount, and food rescue organisations need to effectively
relay this information to their volunteers. As different merchants have
different operational processes and schedules, information is captured
manually, and the flow of communications between stakeholders can be slow
and inefficient.
<br>
<br>A more conducive experience might encourage more F&amp;B establishments
to play their part in reducing food waste on a national scale. How might
we improve the end-to-end process and ensure smoother food rescue operations,
thereby onboarding more businesses to redistribute surplus food through
organisations in the food surplus/waste space?</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>We propose an integrated digital platform designed to optimise surplus
food redistribution operations between the three main groups of stakeholders.
<br>
<br>1. Donors (food businesses): Giving them the ability to easily create
listings of available surplus food with photos, tags and collection time-frame
<br>2. Volunteers: Automated matching to suitable collection windows
<br>3. Rescue group coordinators: Dashboard and logging systems to provide
an oversight of listings and collection status through real-time updates
<br>
<br>By reducing the administrative burden and increasing the efficiency of
these missions, more businesses and organisations will be encouraged to
join the food waste reduction movement, contributing to Singapore’s Zero
Waste Masterplan targets.</p>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>The lack of effective communication amongst various welfare and care organisations
leads to a fragmented continuum of care for seniors, especially those with
inadequate social support. How might we allow organisations to communicate
effectively and safely to provide holistic care for elderly with limited
social support?</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>The lack of effective communication amongst various welfare and care organisations
leads to a fragmented continuum of care for seniors, especially those living
alone. We want to build a simple solution to allow organisations to communicate
effectively and safely to provide holistic care for elderly living alone.
In essence, we want to better serve the people already serving our target
beneficiary.
<br>
<br><strong>Proposed Solution</strong>
<br>We aim to consolidate seniors' care and visit histories to improve the
overall continuum of care. This holistic view will enable them to better
understand and assess the needs of the seniors they serve. With the implementation
of a user-friendly mobile-first web application, care workers can securely
access and share information, while prioritizing the seniors' privacy.
This platform allows care workers and volunteers to check in, review previous
care histories, and document details related to their visits, fostering
a more informed and coordinated approach to senior care.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Impact<br></strong>- Better planning of future care
<br>- Prevent overlap of services that misallocates resources and confuses
beneficiaries
<br>- Allow organisations to seek help from other volunteers to help with
urgent tasks</p>

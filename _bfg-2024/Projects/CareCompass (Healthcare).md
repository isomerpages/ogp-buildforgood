<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p><strong>Background</strong>
<br>Almost everyone has been, is or will be a caregiver to someone else. This
resonates particularly in the Singapore context, where the confluence of
a rapidly ageing society and societal norms around familial responsibilities
mean that the prevalence and burden of informal (unpaid) caregiving for
seniors will only rise. Already, a 2020 study by Duke-NUS estimated that
the cost of informal caregiving for seniors in Singapore comes up to $1.28
billion a year, with caregivers putting in more than 60.5 hours per week
looking after seniors (Duke-NUS, 2024). 12,400 Singapore residents have
also given up their jobs due to caregiving responsibilities for their parents
(MOM, 2022).
<br>
<br>Given the time and resource-intensivity of informal caregiving, it is
no wonder that 53.4% of caregivers feel that they are barely coping or
burdened (NCSS, 2022). For certain conditions such as dementia, the burden
of care on caregivers is twice as high compared to conditions other than
dementia (WiSE study, 2023). The top challenges include managing behavioural
changes (cited by 70% of caregivers), emotional stress and burnout (67%),
coping with disease progression (57%) and juggling personal and professional
life (57%) (Dementia SG, 2024).
<br>
<br>In our user interviews, searching for and navigating to relevant information
to support loved ones was a common pain point underlying these challenges.
While healthcare providers could be helpful if they were not busy, the
long time between appointments (in the public system) meant that caregivers
would need to take matters into their own hands. Research has found that
caregivers (57%) of patients with dementia would turn to friends or family
for advice, as our interviewees did in hopes of obtaining more specific
advice that they could trust (Dementia SG, 2024). If not, online search
could be useful but results may be too generic.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Problem statement </strong>
<br>Caregivers of elderly with dementia need to search for and sift through
multiple sources of information to make good care decisions when their
loved ones require informal care. This results in a disproportionate amount
of stress and time spent searching for and evaluating information because
there is no single source of trusted, curated advice on next steps they
should take for their care recipientâ€™s needs.</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>We aim to develop a centralised platform with a conversational chat interface
that takes in user input about the needs of their care recipients and pulls
resources from trusted websites (e.g. DementiaSG, Agency for Integrated
Care) that are regularly maintained. The output would be a set of personalised,
step by step recommendations to help caregivers formulate their care plans.
The chat interface would provide an alternative search experience that
is like talking to a trusted friend instead of clicking through websites.
The personalisation and organisation of plans would also help overcome
the genericity of current online information, increasing the utility of
outputs.
<br>
<br><strong>Impact</strong>
<br>- Reduction in time caregivers spend searching for information (and hence
working hours saved, $ saved)
<br>- Reduction in stress in the search experience
<br>- Additional resource for clinics / social workers to better help patients
and caregivers
<br>- Increase visibility and adoption of resources for community partners

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Seniors living alone need to be regularly monitored at home to ensure
their well-being and detect emergencies. Due to a lack of daily support
and monitoring, there has been an increase in cases (32 in 2023, according
to AIC) where seniors passed away unnoticed.
<br>
</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p><strong>HeartBeat</strong> is a simple and easy-to-use device that helps
keep seniors safe and gives peace of mind to their caregivers. Seniors
just need to check-in via the app once a day and let their caregivers know
they’re okay. If they forget to check in, HeartBeat automatically sends
a text message to their caregiver, so they can follow up quickly. HeartBeat
is designed to be senior-friendly, making it easy for anyone to use without
needing technical skills.</p>
<p>HeartBeat helps seniors stay independent while making sure their loved
ones are always in the loop. It also creates a daily habit that gives seniors
a sense of security and connection. With its practical design and ability
to grow with users’ needs, HeartBeat is making it easier for families and
communities to care for their elderly loved ones.</p>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>In a survey amongst those who have sought and are seeking mental health
support (85.1% were between ages 22 and older), 79.6% of the respondents
were concerned with finding a suitable therapist and 44.9% worry about
establishing rapport with their therapists.
<br>
<br>For the respondents who switch therapists, they switch anywhere between
2 to 7 therapists. In fact, for those who switched, 89% were concerned
about repeating their stories and establishing rapport with their new therapists.
<br>
<br>The concern is warranted, because mental healthcare seekers experience
demoralizing frustration when there is information discontuinity. This
information discontinuity can happen:
<br>
<br>1. between the previous and next session with the same therapist,
<br>2. between old and new therapists within the same organization,
<br>3. between the therapist in previous organization and the next therapist
in the next organization when they are referred from one place to another.
<br>
<br>This results in a poor experience and potentially loss of faith in the
system that leads to increased dropout rates because they feel unsupported
by the system.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>EBI is a companion application for mental health support seekers to:
<br>
<br>- share information with therapists from a community-based mental healthcare
provider
<br>- help describe their issues better for reflection and subsequent sessions
<br>- control and edit their own data for future reference
<br>
<br>These features help with managing information discontuity between sessions
and allows them to share their stories more quickly with therapists.
<br>
<br>For therapists, they can prepare themselves to help mental health support
seekers better and spend more time on building rapport with their patients.</p>

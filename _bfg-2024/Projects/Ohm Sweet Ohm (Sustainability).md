<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Households often lack visibility into their energy use, leading to high
bills and inefficient consumption. There is a need for a solution that
provides actionable insights to help users reduce energy waste and lower
costs.</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
<br>Singapore’s reliance on imported fossil fuels and water, along with energy-intensive
processes like desalination and water reclamation, makes the nation vulnerable
to global market fluctuations and environmental challenges. As fossil fuels
deplete and water treatment demands rise, sustainable management becomes
more urgent, especially with increasing urban needs and climate change.  Despite
national conservation efforts and rising citizen concern about the cost
of living and household expenses, many Singaporeans remain disengaged from
energy and water-saving practices, leading to higher environmental impact
and household costs.
<br>
<br><strong>Proposed Solution</strong>
<br>We are developing a mobile-optimized web app that serves as a cost estimation
calculator. Users can input information about their electrical appliances,
such as wattage and usage frequency, to receive estimated energy consumption
and corresponding costs.
<br>
<br><strong>Benefits</strong>
<br>- Provides users with personalized cost estimates.
<br>- Encourages informed decision-making regarding appliance usage.
<br>- Supports national sustainability goals by promoting energy efficiency.</p>

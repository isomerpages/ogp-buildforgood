<h4><strong>Supporting Seniors - Empowering AAC Volunteers</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>We are a trio from diverse backgrounds, united by a shared mission to
create a kinder, more inclusive Singapore – especially for our seniors!
Together, we are not just building a better tomorrow but also one that
is filled with love and respect for those who have paved the way for us!</p>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>As Singapore's population ages, the number of seniors living alone is
projected to increase, particularly as fewer people choose to form families.
These seniors are especially vulnerable due to the lack of nearby support
and potentially diminished faculties needed to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
Ensuring they are not neglected and can live and leave with dignity requires
consistent outreach and frequent visitations by Active Ageing Centres (AAC)
and volunteers. However, frequent home visits and tracking these visits
and the status of each senior are manpower-intensive, and manpower is a
limited resource.
<br>
<br>While volunteers could help alleviate some of the burden, initiating them
into AACs’ practices and integrating them with the seniors requires significant
resources. Our team believes that robust digital solutions could enhance
AACs' operational efficiency without compromising quality of human interaction.
Such solutions could streamline processes and enable AACs to engage a broader
volunteer base, thus supporting more seniors effectively.
<br>
</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>Leveraging AI, we envision an application designed to streamline the allocation
of manpower and automate the creation of detailed records and checklists
drawing on past data, enabling data analytics that can personalize care.
This tool not only reduces the time spent on preparation and recording
during house visits, but also enhances the Active Ageing Centre (AAC) staff's
ability to connect with each senior on a more personal level. Additionally,
it could significantly ease the volunteer onboarding process for AACs,
enabling AACs to sustain and even expand their senior monitoring systems
effectively.
<br>
<br>Through this tool, we aim to empower AACs to preserve the invaluable human
touch in their services, blending traditional house visits with the efficiency
and precision of digital technology, ensuring seniors receive the attentive
and tailored support they deserve in this digital age.

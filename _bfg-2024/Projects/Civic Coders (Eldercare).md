<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Seniors living alone need to be regularly monitored at home to ensure
their well-being and detect emergencies. Due to a lack of daily support
and monitoring, there has been an increase in cases (32 in 2023, according
to AIC) where seniors passed away unnoticed.
<br>
</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>Seniors deserve to live their final years with dignity, surrounded by
the care and attention they need, not isolated in fear of being forgotten.
The thought of a loved one passing away unnoticed is heartbreaking for
any family.
<br>
<br>Our solution is a gentle, non-intrusive daily check-in system designed
with empathy for isolated seniors. A simple set of button allows seniors
to let their families know theyâ€™re okay, giving them a sense of security
and connection without feeling like a burden. If a senior doesn't check
in within a given timeframe, or if seniors trigger an emergency button,
an immediate alert ensures that help can reach them in time, preventing
the tragedy of being alone in an emergency. This system not only safeguards
their physical well-being but also offers emotional comfort, reminding
seniors that they are seen, cared for, and never truly alone. It provides
families with peace of mind, knowing their loved ones are safe and supported,
even from a distance.</p>

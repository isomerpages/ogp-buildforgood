<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Singaporeâ€™s ageing population is rapidly growing, with nearly 1 million
seniors expected by 2030. Among them, many are less active or social, putting
them at risk of isolation, which affects their health and well-being. Despite
government efforts and volunteer programs, this issue persists.
<br>
<br>Although there are an overwhelming number of citizens (95% of survey respondents)
that would like to help these socially-isolated seniors, only 2% of our
survey respondents actually volunteer with the elderly. This is because
face a few key barriers in doing so: fear of regular commitment (48%),
language barrier with the elderly (45%), and it being too time-consuming
(39%).</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>We aim to democratise and lower the barriers to volunteering by reducing
the dependency on AACs and befriender organisations to allocate and schedule
resources such as volunteer visitations and errand running.
<br>
<br>We intend to rally the community around the elderly by providing a platform
that connects members of the public with one another with a focus on the
socially isolated elderly in their neighbourhood to do simple monitoring
tasks and errand running.
<br>
<br>With this platform, members of a community can work together to check-in
and help out elderlies who need it most, and escalate to the respective
AACs and befriender organisations should the need arise. As a result, AACs
and befriender organisations can now rely on a much larger, closer-to-home
pool of manpower to conduct more frequent checks and assistance for the
socially isolated, and divert resources more efficiently when needed. In
the long run, the younger generation can cultivate organic relationships
with the elderly they support.

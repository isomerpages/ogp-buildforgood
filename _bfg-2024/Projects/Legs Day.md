<h4>Health &amp; Wellbeing - Encouraging Fitness Among Working Adults</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Our team, "Legs Day," recognizes that strong legs are the cornerstone
of overall fitness and athletic performance. Just as how our Legs play
a critical role in any comprehensive fitness regimen, our team aims to
build a strong foundation for health and wellness through our innovative
fitness app.</p>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Singapore's healthcare sector faces mounting pressure from rising demands
and costs, coupled with limited resources. To address this challenge, the
Ministry of Health (MOH) is spearheading the HealthierSG initiative, to
move from a reactive model of treating illness to a proactive approach
of promoting wellness and prevention. While the percentage of residents
engaging in sufficient total physical activity has increased to 78.5% in
2023, only one-thirds (33.7%) of Singapore residents reported having sufficient
muscle-strengthening activities.
<br>
<br>According the the updated HPB guidelines, individuals are encouraged to
engage in muscle strengthening activity at moderate- or vigorous-intensity
at least 2 days a week as these activities to improve their overall wellness
in body composition, bone health, cognitive functions and mental health.
<br>
<br>We discovered that beginner working adults who wants to engage in muscle-strenghtening
activities don't know the right exercises to do. This results in the individuals
not starting/continuing strength training to achieve the best preventive
health outcomes. There is a need to reduce this friction and provide them
a seamless experience when navigating through their first foray into resistance
training.
<br>
</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>We plan to develop a no-frills fitness app solution targeted at busy working
adults looking to start their muscle building journey. The app will feature
a simplified interface that recommends short and attainable workout programs
and challenges through <s>gamification</s>, educating users on various muscle-strengthening
activities. Our solution aims to help users familiarize themselves with
workouts, develop habits, and maintain consistency. All exercises will
meet the Health Promotion Board (HPB) guidelines quota of 8-10 sets of
8-12 repetitions for muscle-strengthening activities.
<br>
<br><strong>Key Features</strong>
<br>
<br><strong>Short-Form Curated Workouts: </strong>
<br>- Users will be greeted with a simplified user interface showcasing brief
workouts.
<br>- These short-form exercises will educate users on proper techniques and
program structure.
<br>- This approach helps users familiarize themselves with activities, kickstarting
their muscle strengthening journey.
<br>
<br><strong>Goal-Oriented Programs:</strong>
<br>- The app will recommend workouts and programs based on user-selected
goals (e.g., muscle building, maintenance).
<br>- Setting goal-oriented programs allows users to express preferences.
<br>- The app will develop personalized plans tailored to each user's objectives.
<br>
<br><strong>Individual Challenges Leaderboard</strong>
<br>- A leaderboard will allow users to track their progression and personal
bests.
<br>- This feature enables users to see clear improvements over time.
<br>- The gamification aspect encourages consistency and motivation.</p>

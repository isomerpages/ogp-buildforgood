<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>As Singapore's population ages, the number of seniors living alone is
projected to increase, particularly as fewer people choose to form families.
These seniors are especially vulnerable due to the lack of nearby support
and potentially diminished faculties needed to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
Ensuring they are not neglected and can live and leave with dignity requires
consistent outreach and frequent visitations by Active Ageing Centres (AAC)
and volunteers. However, frequent home visits and tracking these visits
and the status of each senior are manpower-intensive, and manpower is a
limited resource.
<br>
<br>While volunteers could help alleviate some of the burden, initiating them
into AACs’ practices and integrating them with the seniors requires significant
resources. Our team believes that robust digital solutions could enhance
AACs' operational efficiency without compromising quality of human interaction.
Such solutions could streamline processes and enable AACs to engage a broader
volunteer base, thus supporting more seniors effectively.
<br>
</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>Our application empowers AAC staff and volunteers to conduct more personalized
house visits for socially isolated seniors while seamlessly digitizing
visitation records. By leveraging AI, the application equips staff and
volunteers with contextual knowledge about seniors before visits, generates
dynamic, personalized questions to enhance engagement during or after visits,
and provides managers with a comprehensive overview of visitation activities.
Additionally, it offers actionable insights for timely interventions in
critical situations.</p>
<p>Through this tool, we aim to empower AACs to preserve the invaluable human
touch in their services, blending traditional house visits with the efficiency
and precision of digital technology, ensuring these seniors receive the
attentive and tailored support they deserve in this digital age while streamlining
the AACs’ operations and easing their workload.

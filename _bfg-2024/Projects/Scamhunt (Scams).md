<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND<br></strong>As per Cybercrime Brief for 2024, more
scammers are targeting victims through Meta platforms (Facebook, WhatsApp,
Instagram), and Telegram.
<br>
<br>Reported cases have increased to 8,336 from 6,555 last year. For ~85%
of reported social media scams, scammers used these platforms to contact
potential victims.
<br>
<br>Of the total scam victims, adults aged 30 to 49 made up the largest proportion.
<br>
<br>Social media platforms are home to all the top scams reported this year
including Job scams, Phishing scams, E-commerce scams and Investment scams.
<br><strong><br><a href="https://www.scamshield.gov.sg/files/Scams%20and%20Cybercrime%20Briefs/2024_Mid_Year_SCC_Brief.pdf" class="in-cell-link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>SOURCE</u></a><br><br><br>PROBLEM STATEMENT <br><br></strong>Anti-scam
government agencies struggle to effectively request removal of scam posts
on social media platforms like Facebook &amp; Insta because they lack access
to scams reported by users on these platforms.
<br>
<br>Ineffective takedown requests and slower identification of new scam threats
is causing Singaporeans to lose millions per year.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>A Telegram bot that enables Singaporeans to easily report scams by sharing
links and screenshots for social media scam posts.
<br>It then compiles this data into usable reports for authorities to make
effective takedown requests.
<br>
<br>This is not possible in Scamshield app right now.
<br>
<br>Singaporeans can contribute additional information about their reported
scams, view their contributions, and track their personal impact and a
leaderboard to see top scam hunters in Singapore.
<br>
<br>Future versions will bring Scamhunt bots to more messaging platforms and
support additional media formats for easier scam reporting.
<br>
<br>The core gaming aspect will be enhanced to include badges, weekly challenges,
group-based hunting mini-games and more!
<br>
<br>Scamhunt aims to create a centralized database of social media scam reports
for authorities to identify, respond to and request takedowns for new threat
quickly.
<br>
<br>This will reduce the risk of financial losses and keep Singaporeans safe.
<br>
<br>Ignoring a scam only saves you, reporting it saves everyone.
<br>
<br>Happy Hunting!</p>

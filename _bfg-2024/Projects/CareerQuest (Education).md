<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Junior College (JC) students need to make informed decisions about their
university courses and career paths immediately after completing JC. Despite
existing Educational and Career Guidance (ECG) programmes and existing
services like Discover On My Way (NYC) and MySkillsFuture, they are still
uncertain and stressed about future options, as they have limited access
to authentic information and first-hand experiences, and often feel unprepared
or unsure about what questions to ask career guidance counsellors to guide
them in making more informed decisions.</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>While there are a number of ECG programmes in JCs which allow students
to get information on different industries and careers, there is a gap
in students' insight on real industry experiences or authentic opinions
from different professionals.<strong><br><br></strong>To address this issue,
we propose the creation of a centralised platform designed to facilitate
effective communication and interaction between Industry Professionals
and JC Students. This will serve as a complementary platform to existing
ECG resource portals used by MOE and the schools.
<br>
<br><strong>Key Features of the ECG Portal:<br><br></strong>1. Personalised
Career Guidance: Students will be given industry and career suggestions
based on what they're good at, what they enjoy, and what is needed in the
world.
<br>2. Direct Professional Connections: Students will be able to chat and
schedule meetings with industry professionals directly through the portal,
giving them a platform other than industry talks to ask questions on different
careers. Improving existing ECG services by introducing additional connections
with industry professionals will also complement the role of ECG counsellors
in school in providing authentic experiences.</p>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>In Singapore, many consumers try to save money by purchasing discounted
items that require a minimum order quantity. However, this often leads
to overconsumption, as individuals end up buying more than they need just
to meet the required amount for a discount. The current group buying process
is highly unstructured, with people relying on group chats to find others
to share their orders. This inefficient approach makes it difficult to
connect with the right participants, leading to unnecessary purchases and
wasted resources. The lack of a streamlined system contributes to these
inefficiencies and prevents customers from fully realizing the potential
savings without overbuying.</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>A centralized platform designed to streamline the group buying process,
specifically tackling the issue of overconsumption caused by uncoordinated
purchases. This platform will allow users to efficiently find others to
share orders, helping them reach discount thresholds without buying more
than necessary.
<br>
<br><strong>Features:<br></strong>- Real-Time Visibility: Users can easily
see available slots in ongoing group buys, ensuring they find the right
group to join without overbuying.
<br>- Automated Order Management: The platform will manage group capacity
with features like waiting lists and alternative group options to prevent
oversubscription.
<br>- Logistics Coordination: Seamless management of payment collection and
delivery scheduling to reduce manual coordination and ensure smooth transactions.
<br>- Consolidated Interface: A single platform that aggregates all group
buy information, offering clear updates and notifications to reduce communication
overload.
<br>
<br><strong>Impact:<br></strong>By enhancing transparency and simplifying
logistics, the platform will help users save money while avoiding overconsumption.
It fosters more responsible buying habits and promotes cooperative consumption,
benefiting both individuals and the broader community.</p>

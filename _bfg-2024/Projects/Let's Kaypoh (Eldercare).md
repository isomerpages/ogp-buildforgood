<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Singaporeâ€™s ageing population is rapidly growing, with nearly 1 million
seniors expected by 2030. Among them, many are less active or social, putting
them at risk of isolation, which affects their health and well-being. Despite
government efforts and volunteer programs, this issue persists.
<br>
<br>Although there are an overwhelming number of citizens (95% of survey respondents)
that would like to help these socially-isolated seniors, only 2% of our
survey respondents actually volunteer with the elderly. This is because
face a few key barriers in doing so: fear of regular commitment (48%),
language barrier with the elderly (45%), and it being too time-consuming
(39%).</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>Let's Kaypoh is a platform that rallies the community to discover and
check-in on nearby socially isolated elderly, reducing the reliance of
senior monitoring on AACs and befriender organisations, and decreasing
senior loneliness.
<br>
<br>Through a pilot conducted with SASCO West Coast AAC, Let's Kaypoh has
facilitated 10 senior visits by 20 volunteers, and consolidated data on
overall senior wellbeing for the AAC to monitor.

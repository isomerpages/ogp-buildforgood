<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Residents in Singapore often struggle to receive timely and relevant information
about their neighbourhoods of interest, such as water or electrical supply
disruptions, hawker centre closures, or fumigation schedules. Currently,
residents rely on noticeboards in void decks, lift lobbies, word of mouth,
or neighbourhood chat groups to stay informed. There are many touchpoints.
<br>
<br>While some estates offer dedicated apps, their availability is limited
and doesn’t address the needs of all residents. This fragmented approach
to communication often results in missed updates, leading to inconvenience
and disruption when important information about maintenance, service interruptions,
or events are overlooked. The current state results in inefficient communication,
causes inconveniences and may negatively impact residents’ daily lives.
<br>
<br>How might we improve people's living experience in Singapore by reducing
inconvenience as a result of missing important information in their neighbourhoods
of interest?</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>Our solution addresses this issue by providing a centralised platform
that delivers information about neighbourhoods of interest. Whether it's
scheduled maintenance, service disruptions, or events, the platform ensures
that residents across Singapore are well-informed and connected in a timely
and accessible manner.
<br>
<br>Key features of our platform include instant updates, personalized filters
that allow users to receive notices specific to their block or region,
and multiple language options for broader accessibility. The platform also
offers scheduled reminders for less frequent events and the ability to
adjust notification frequency, ensuring users are only alerted when necessary.
<br>
<br>With the centralised platform, residents can receive timely and relevant
information and reminders on-the-go for neighbourhoods of interest, thereby
resolving inconveniences caused by missing important information, and hence
improving their living experience in Singapore.</p>

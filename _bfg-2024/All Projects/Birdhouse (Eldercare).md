<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Isolated seniors in Singapore value their independence and are at a greater
risk of adverse events, such as falls or sudden illness, going unnoticed
when they live alone. Next-of-kin who do not live with their senior relatives
face challenges in monitoring them, leading to constant concerns about
their safety.
<br>
<br>While there are plans to expand the number of Active Ageing Centers (AACs)
to better support the seniors, these centers faces significant challenges
in providing adequate support due to limited volunteers, time, and budget.
Furthermore, many existing technological solutions for senior care are
too costly and not designed to integrate smoothly with the centers' daily
operations. This creates a gap that leaves seniors vulnerable to delayed
care and places burden on already overstretched caregivers.</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>Our cost-effective and scalable Birdhouse motion sensor solution provides
continuous, real-time monitoring of seniors' activity levels in the comfort
of their homes.
<br>
<br>By placing small and discreet motion sensors throughout key areas of the
home, the system detects any changes in daily activity patterns. If inactivity
is detected for a pre-set period, an AI bot automatically sends an alert
to the senior's next of kin, prompting them to check in. Should the family
member not respond within time, the care center's staff will receive an
alert through the Birdhouse dashboard or via email.
<br>
<br>This solution seamlessly integrates with AACs, offering real-time, actionable
insights for timely intervention. Through this approach—monitoring seniors'
safety while maintaining their independence—Birdhouse aims to ensures that
seniors living alone are safeguarded while giving peace of mind to both
families and caregivers.
<br>
<br><strong>Benefits for AACs</strong>
<br>- Streamlined check-in workflow, through seamless integration and AI/ML
pattern recognition and analysis
<br>- Enhanced senior engagement
<br>- Alleviates strain on caregivers
<br>
<br><strong>Benefits for Seniors</strong>
<br>- A cost-effective solution for a peace of mind
<br>- Timely access to care
<br>- Reduced risk of undetected emergencies</p>

<h3><strong>Who can be a builder?</strong></h3>
<p>Anyone aged 18 and above with a strong desire to make Singapore better
is welcome to sign up to be a builder. Applicants may join as a team or
as individuals, though during the hackathon, all builders will be required
to form teams of 3 to 5.</p>
<p>Here are the four core attributes which we use to assess applications:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Commitment: Is the applicant able to commit for all weekly sessions, and
willing to continue working on the solution beyond the hackathon?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initiative: Has the applicant demonstrated that he/she has thought through
the problem space, and even proposed possible solutions to the problem?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Values: Are there any past projects / involvement that demonstrates the
applicant's commitment to public good?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abilities: What's the level of technical expertise the applicant has in
his/her own field?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>What kind of solutions can you come up with?</strong></h3>
<p>Your solution should be a tech solution that addresses a public good problem
in Singapore. It should not be an existing solution which was built before
the hackathon period.</p>
<p>You will be required to demonstrate a working prototype that's backed
by user testing at the finale.</p>

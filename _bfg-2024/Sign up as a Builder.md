<h3><strong>Who can be a builder?</strong></h3>
<p>Anyone aged 18 and above with a strong desire to make Singapore better is welcome
to sign up to be a builder. Applicants may join as a team or as individuals,
though during the hackathon, all builders will be required to
form teams of 3 to 5.</p>
<p>Here are the four core attributes which we use to assess applications:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Commitment: Is the applicant able to commit for all weekly sessions, and
willing to continue working on the solution beyond the hackathon?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initiative: Has the applicant demonstrated that he/she has thought through
the problem space, and even proposed possible solutions to the problem?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Values: Are there any past projects / involvement that demonstrates the applicant's
commitment to public good?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abilities: What's the level of technical expertise the applicant has
in his/her own field?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>What kind of solutions can you come up with?</strong></h3>
<p>Your solution should be a digital/physical product or service that addresses
an <a href="/environment" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">environmental problem</a> in Singapore.</p>
<p>You will be required to demonstrate a working prototype that's backed by user
testing at the finale.</p>

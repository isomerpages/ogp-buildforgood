<h3><strong>Build for Good Accelerator</strong></h3>
<p>Following the hackathon, 5 teams moved on to an 8-week accelerator programme
to further advance their solutions for public good, with S$20,000 funding
support.&nbsp;The accelerator programme focuses on imparting skills, knowledge
and networks essential for scaling solutions through sustained growth,
and launch them with real users.

<h3><strong>Build for Good Accelerator</strong></h3>
<p>Following the hackathon, 5 teams moved on to an 8-week accelerator programme
to further advance their solutions for public good, with S$20,000 funding
support.&nbsp;The accelerator programme focuses on imparting skills, knowledge
and networks essential for scaling solutions through sustained growth,
and launch them with real users.

<h4>Let's Kaypoh</h4>
<p>Let's Kaypoh is a platform that rallies the community to discover and
check-in on nearby socially isolated elderly, reducing the reliance of
senior monitoring on AACs and befriender organisations, and decreasing
senior loneliness.
<br>
<br>Through a pilot conducted with SASCO West Coast AAC, Let's Kaypoh has
facilitated 10 senior visits by 20 volunteers, and consolidated data on
overall senior wellbeing for the AAC to monitor.</p>

<h4>CareCompass</h4>
<p>New family caregivers of dementia patients are often overwhelmed by the
many decisions they have to make for their loved ones and the strain on
their own mental/emotional health. While caregivers may receive some support
from hospitals at point of diagnosis, there remains a gap for caregivers
who search for help in community settings.
<br>
<br>For new family caregivers of patients with dementia, CareCompass is a
personalised care navigator that facilitates quicker, less stressful day-to-day
care.
<br>
<br>To address this, CareCompass:
<br>1. Displays 3 top, personalised recommendations on topics including care
services and support based on caregivers’ stated preferences
<br>2. Features a conversational chatbot trained on publicly available resources
from trusted partners (e.g. Dementia Singapore, AIC) for interactive, instant
guidance on topics outside of the recommenders above
<br>3. Will close the loop with community touchpoints (e.g. Community Outreach
Teams (CREST)) for caregivers desiring to speak with a professional for
further advice</p>

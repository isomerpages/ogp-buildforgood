<h3><strong>Build for Good Starter Fund</strong></h3>
<p>The Build for Good starter fund was newly introduced in Oct 2024 to support
citizen teams who are keen to continue pursuing their solutions for public
good. The S$5,000 fund aims to empower and encourage these teams to continue
refining their solutions, explore small-scale pilots, and launch their
solutions to make a real impact.</p>

<h4>Heart Beat (eldercare)</h4>
<p><strong>HeartBeat</strong> is a simple and easy-to-use device that helps
keep seniors safe and gives peace of mind to their caregivers. Seniors
just need to check-in via the app once a day and let their caregivers know
they’re okay. If they forget to check in, HeartBeat automatically sends
a text message to their caregiver, so they can follow up quickly. HeartBeat
is designed to be senior-friendly, making it easy for anyone to use without
needing technical skills.</p>
<p>HeartBeat helps seniors stay independent while making sure their loved
ones are always in the loop. It also creates a daily habit that gives seniors
a sense of security and connection. With its practical design and ability
to grow with users’ needs, HeartBeat is making it easier for families and
communities to care for their elderly loved ones.</p>

<h4>Ho Seh Bo (eldercare)</h4>

conduct more personalized house visits for socially isolated seniors while
seamlessly digitizing visitation records. By leveraging AI, the application

visits, generates dynamic, personalized questions to enhance engagement
during or after visits, and provides managers with a comprehensive overview
of visitation activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers actionable insights for timely interventions in
critical situations. Through this tool, we aim to empower AACs to preserve
the invaluable human touch in their services, blending traditional house
visits with the efficiency and precision of digital technology, ensuring
these seniors receive the attentive and tailored support they deserve in
this digital age while streamlining the AACs’ operations and easing their
workload.&nbsp;</p>

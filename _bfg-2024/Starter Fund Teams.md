<h3><strong>Build for Good Starter Fund</strong></h3>
<p>The Build for Good starter fund was newly introduced in Oct 2024 to support
citizen teams who are keen to continue pursuing their solutions for public
good. The S$5,000 fund aims to empower and encourage these teams to continue
refining their solutions, explore small-scale pilots, and launch their
solutions to make a real impact.</p>

<h4>Heart Beat (eldercare)</h4>
<p><strong>HeartBeat</strong> is a simple and easy-to-use device that helps
keep seniors safe and gives peace of mind to their caregivers. Seniors
just need to check-in via the app once a day and let their caregivers know
they’re okay. If they forget to check in, HeartBeat automatically sends
a text message to their caregiver, so they can follow up quickly. HeartBeat
is designed to be senior-friendly, making it easy for anyone to use without
needing technical skills.</p>
<p>HeartBeat helps seniors stay independent while making sure their loved
ones are always in the loop. It also creates a daily habit that gives seniors
a sense of security and connection. With its practical design and ability
to grow with users’ needs, HeartBeat is making it easier for families and
communities to care for their elderly loved ones.</p>

<h4>CareCard (eldercare)</h4>
<p>CareCard is a mobile-first web application that consolidates seniors'
care and visit histories for care workers to better understand and assess
the needs of the seniors they serve. With CareCard, care workers and volunteers
can check in, review previous care histories, and document details related
to their visits, fostering a more informed and coordinated approach to
senior care.</p>

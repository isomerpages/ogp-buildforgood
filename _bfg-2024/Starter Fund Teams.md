<h3><strong>Build for Good Starter Fund</strong></h3>
<p>The Build for Good starter fund was newly introduced in Oct 2024 to support
citizen teams who are keen to continue pursuing their solutions for public
good. The S$5,000 fund aims to empower and encourage these teams to continue
refining their solutions, explore small-scale pilots, and launch their
solutions to make a real impact.</p>

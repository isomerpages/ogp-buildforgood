<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>The manual booking process at senior gyms leads to wasted slots, low attendance,
and extended waitlists due to frequent rescheduling by participants. This
inefficiency burdens instructors, pulling them away from their primary
responsibilities, while seniors struggle to track their progress or manage
schedules effectively.</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>GymLah is a tailored booking application for senior gyms in Singapore.
It simplifies scheduling for instructors and empowers seniors to manage
their progress independently.
<br>
<br><strong>Key Benefits:</strong>
<br>- For Instructors: Saves time by automating booking and providing actionable
insights via dashboards.
<br>- For Seniors: Enables easy self-service rescheduling and tracking to
stay engaged with their fitness journey.
<br>
<br><strong>Value Proposition:</strong>
<br>GymLah streamlines operations, increases attendance, and reduces waitlists,
making senior fitness programs more efficient and impactful. By letting
instructors focus on what matters most—delivering quality training—it enhances
program effectiveness while supporting healthier aging in Singapore.

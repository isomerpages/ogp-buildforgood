<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>In a survey amongst those who have sought and are seeking mental health
support (85.1% were between ages 22 and older), 79.6% of the respondents
were concerned with finding a suitable therapist and 44.9% worry about
establishing rapport with their therapists.
<br>
<br>The concern is warranted, because mental healthcare seekers experience
demoralizing frustration when there is information discontuinity. This
information discontinuity can happen:
<br>
<br>1. when there are long waits between the previous and next session with
their therapist,
<br>2. not being able to find a topic to talk about
<br>
<br>This results in a poor experience and potentially loss of faith in the
system that leads to increased dropout rates because they feel unsupported
by the system.
<br>
<br>In additional, therapists having no way of tracking the wellness of the
mental healthcare seeker between sessions apart from journaling and other
apps that help provide proxy data to wellness, e.g., sleep cycles and steps
walked. On the other hand, helpful techniques such as journalling can be
a challenge because it is a hassle to type/write continuously.
<br>
</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>EBI is a journaling app designed to help users explore and communicate
their thoughts clearly, with data-driven insights into their progress.
Key features include AI-powered prompts for deeper emotional exploration
and auto-generated, shareable summaries that extract key insights, making
it easier for users to reflect and share their journeys.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, we aspire to be a community where anyone seeking mental health
support feels at home. Our mission goes beyond journaling â€” we aim to raise
mental health awareness and foster well-being for everyone.</p>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>A recent National Youth Mental Health Study revealed that nearly a third
of young people aged 15 to 35 experience persistent feelings of emptiness,
tension, or distress, underscoring the growing national priority on mental
health. Recognizing the importance of mental well-being for a functional
society, EBI addresses key challenges faced by three user personas:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Therapy users frustrated by repeating their stories when switching providers
or tracking progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regular journalers who struggle to explore emotions or gain new perspectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individuals dealing with significant life events, seeking ways to manage
overwhelming feelings.
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>EBI is a journaling app designed to help users explore and communicate
their thoughts clearly, with data-driven insights into their progress.
Key features include AI-powered prompts for deeper emotional exploration
and auto-generated, shareable summaries that extract key insights, making
it easier for users to reflect and share their journeys.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, we aspire to be a community where anyone seeking mental health
support feels at home. Our mission goes beyond journaling â€” we aim to raise
mental health awareness and foster well-being for everyone.</p>

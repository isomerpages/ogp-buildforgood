<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p><strong>Background</strong>
<br>Almost everyone has been, is or will be a caregiver to someone else. This
resonates particularly in the Singapore context, where the confluence of
a rapidly ageing society and societal norms around familial responsibilities
mean that the prevalence and burden of informal (unpaid) caregiving for
seniors will only rise. Already, a 2020 study by Duke-NUS estimated that
the cost of informal caregiving for seniors in Singapore comes up to $1.28
billion a year, with caregivers putting in more than 60.5 hours per week
looking after seniors (Duke-NUS, 2024). 12,400 Singapore residents have
also given up their jobs due to caregiving responsibilities for their parents
(MOM, 2022).
<br>
<br>Given the time and resource-intensivity of informal caregiving, it is
no wonder that 53.4% of caregivers feel that they are barely coping or
burdened (NCSS, 2022). For certain conditions such as dementia, the burden
of care on caregivers is twice as high compared to conditions other than
dementia (WiSE study, 2023). The top challenges include managing behavioural
changes (cited by 70% of caregivers), emotional stress and burnout (67%),
coping with disease progression (57%) and juggling personal and professional
life (57%) (Dementia SG, 2024).
<br>
<br>In our user interviews, searching for and navigating to relevant information
to support loved ones was a common pain point underlying these challenges.
While healthcare providers could be helpful if they were not busy, the
long time between appointments (in the public system) meant that caregivers
would need to take matters into their own hands. Research has found that
caregivers (57%) of patients with dementia would turn to friends or family
for advice, as our interviewees did in hopes of obtaining more specific
advice that they could trust (Dementia SG, 2024). If not, online search
could be useful but results may be too generic.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Problem statement </strong>
<br>New family caregivers of dementia patients are often overwhelmed by the
many decisions they have to make for their loved ones and the strain on
their own mental/emotional health. While caregivers may receive some support
from hospitals at point of diagnosis, there remains a gap for caregivers
who search for help in community settings.</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>For new family caregivers of patients with dementia, CareCompass is a
personalised care navigator that facilitates quicker, less stressful day-to-day
care.
<br>
<br><strong>To address this, CareCompass:</strong>
<br>1. Displays 3 top, personalised recommendations on topics including care
services and support based on caregiversâ€™ stated preferences
<br>2. Features a conversational chatbot trained on publicly available resources
from trusted partners (e.g. Dementia Singapore, AIC) for interactive, instant
guidance on topics outside of the recommenders above
<br>3. Will close the loop with community touchpoints (e.g. Community Outreach
Teams (CREST)) for caregivers desiring to speak with a professional for
further advice</p>

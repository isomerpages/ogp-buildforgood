<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p><strong><u>Community Monitoring for Vulnerable Seniors<br></u></strong>As
Singapore’s population ages, the nation is expected to have 100,000 seniors
with mild disabilities—those unable to perform at least one basic daily
activity—and 83,000 living alone by 2030 (SingStat, 2022). In response,
the Silver Generation Office (SGO), a division of the Agency for Integrated
Care (AIC), is piloting the Community Monitoring System (CMS) pilot programme.
This initiative focuses on at-risk seniors living alone with health ailment
and / or poor social support, ensuring they receive frequent home visits
for closer monitoring and timely support.
<br>
<br>In piloting the CMS, SGO's key role is to oversee and coordinate the care
of at-risk seniors. By collecting real-time data on these home visits and
interventions, CMS partners (SGO, AACs, and PA) can respond promptly to
signs of distress and ensure the well-being of seniors under their care.
<br>
<br><strong><u>The Importance of Home Visits<br></u></strong>Isolation and
physical limitations make regular home visits critical for these seniors.
Staffs and volunteers are trained to detect early signs of distress, ensuring
that timely interventions—such as medical assistance or social support—can
be provided. Research indicates that home visits can significantly reduce
mortality rates and delay the need for long-term care (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC56889/ Rossum" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Elkan et al., 2001</a>).
Those in poorer health benefit most, with targeted interventions leading
to greater effectiveness (<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/307/6895/27.short￼MSJ" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Rossum et al., 1993</a>;
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/014067369293294W" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">MSJ et al., 1992</a>).
<br>
<br>During the first three months of the CMS pilot, 5-10% of seniors received
life-changing support, including nurse check-ins, social worker referrals,
and hospitalizations for deteriorating health.
<br>
<br><strong><u>Challenges Faced by SGO and Community Partners (AAC and PA staffs)<br></u></strong>Despite
early successes, several challenges hinder the CMS programme’s scalability:
<br><strong>(1) Inefficient Visit Tracking: </strong>AAC and PA staff submit
data manually using FormSG for each visit, leading to low submission rates
and inaccurate data. Many centres also use their own systems, like Excel
sheets, making it difficult to consolidate data for effective monitoring.
<br><strong>(2) Untracked Visitations: </strong>With only four full-time staff
managing up to 70 unique home visits weekly at an AAC branch, teams may
face significant strain in terms of resourcing. Currently, visits by community
partners such as CREST and informal check-ins by neighbors are not recorded
in the system. Capturing these untracked visits is crucial, as it would
provide valuable data and help reduce the burden on staff.
<br>

<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p><strong><u>HowAreYou: Empowering Communities to Care for the Elderly<br></u></strong>With
a growing elderly population and limited resources, ensuring the well-being
of vulnerable elderly individuals requires a collective effort. HowAreYou
is a community-driven platform that enhances monitoring systems through
QR technology, real-time data tracking, and GPS location. By integrating
these features, HowAreYou enables both staff and volunteers/community to
contribute, filling gaps in existing processes and ensuring comprehensive
support for every elderly person.
<br>
<br><strong><u>How It Works<br></u></strong>Each elderly individual under
the Community Monitoring System (CMS) is assigned a unique QR code displayed
outside their residence. Volunteers and community members (e.g. neighbours)
can scan this code to register their visit and optionally upload a photo.
This documentation assists staff in monitoring the elderly and encourages
community participation in their care.
<br>
<br><strong><u>Additional Features for Staff<br></u>1. Access to Elderly Information: </strong>Staff
from SGO, AAC, and PA can view detailed information about the elderly and
register interactions from anywhere, even without scanning QR codes.
<br><strong>2. Smart Recommendations:</strong> The platform offers recommendations
based on GPS location, identifying nearby elderly individuals who may need
attention or who haven’t been visited recently.
<br><strong>3. Real-Time Monitoring: </strong>HowAreYou provides a real-time
view of interactions across Singapore, consolidating data from public and
staff visits. This enhances monitoring accuracy, facilitates timely responses,
and reduces administrative burden.
<br>
<br><strong><u>Why HowAreYou Matters<br></u></strong>HowAreYou addresses staff
shortages and untracked visits by leveraging community involvement, smart
technology, and real-time GPS data. It ensures a more connected and responsive
approach to supporting high-risk elderly individuals.

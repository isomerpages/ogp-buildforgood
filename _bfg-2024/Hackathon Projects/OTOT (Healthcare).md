<p>Our team, "Legs Day," recognizes that strong legs are the cornerstone
of overall fitness and athletic performance. Just as how our Legs play
a critical role in any comprehensive fitness regimen, our team aims to
build a strong foundation for health and wellness through our innovative
fitness app.</p>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Singapore's healthcare sector faces increasing demands and costs with
limited resources. To address this challenge, we aim to engage in preventive
healthcare through promoting wellness. However, while Singaporeâ€™s physical
activity engagement has increased to 78.5% in 2023, only one-third (33.7%)
of the population performs sufficient muscle-strengthening activities (National
Population Health Survey 2023).
<br>
<br>Of these users, we discovered that working adults who intend to start
their muscle-strengthening training activities are hesitant to participate
as they are overwhelmed by the exercises or programs and have general misconceptions
towards the activities. As a result, this prevents individuals from participating
in any muscle strengthening activities, reducing their overall quality
of health.
<br>
</p>
<h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
<p>We plan to develop a simple fitness app solution targeted at working adults
looking to start their muscle strengthening journey. The app will feature
a simplified interface that recommends short and attainable workout programs
while also educating users on various misconceptions on muscle-strengthening
activities. Our solution aims to help users feel more assured and to familiarize
themselves with workouts, develop habits, and maintain consistency so they
will be inclined to progress and participate in the activities. Recommended
exercises and programs will utilise the Health Promotion Board (HPB) guidelines
as guidance.
<br><strong><br><u>Key features</u></strong>
<br>
<br><strong>Curated Workouts Programs:</strong>
<br>- Users will be provided a personalised workout program based on their
inputs with step-by-step guidance on resistance training.
<br>- These programs are designed to be beginner-friendly and will educate
users on proper techniques in a digestible format.
<br>- This approach helps users to gain confidence and kickstarting their
muscle strengthening journey for a lifelong health.
<br>
<br><strong>Educational Digital Library</strong>
<br>- Users will be greeted with a digital library that neatly categorises
videos and articles on resistance training
<br>- The library will contain short how-to guides, videos and articles to
address common questions and misconceptions asked from starting resistance
training.
<br>- The library acts as a resource for users to reference to understand
how resistance training can benefit their health and potentially receive
updated from HPB
<br>
<br><strong>Motivational Reminders</strong>
<br>- Thoroughout key points in the app, we will place encouragements and
motivational reminders to engage users and drive repeat engagements
<br>- Some features include a fitness weekly log, streaks and post-program
reviews
